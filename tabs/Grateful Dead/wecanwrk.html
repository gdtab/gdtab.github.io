We Can Work It Out
Lennon/McCartney
D             Dsus4   D
Try to see it my      way, 
Dsus4                        C               D   Dsus4  D
Do I have to keep on talking 'til I can't go on?
D                Dsus4  D 
While you see it your   way 
                Dsus4            C                D
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone.
G              D    G              A
We can work it out, we can work it out.

Think of what you're saying.  
You can get it wrong but still you think that it's all right.
Think of what I'm saying.  
We can work it out and get it straight or say goodnight.
We can work it out, we can work it out.

Bm                     A          G      F#                        
Life is very short and there's no ti-i-i-ime 
                Bm            A          G     F#
For fussing and fighting my friends
Bm                         A      G         F#                  
I have always thought that it's a cri-i-i-i-ime, 
          Bm      A      G      F#
So I will ask you once again.

Try to see it my way, 
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong.
While you see it your way, 
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long.
We can work it out, We can work it out.

D     G     D
