The Sweet Sunny South
Traditional

Take me back to the place where I first saw the light,
To the sweet sunny south take me home,
Where the mockingbirds sing me to sleep every night,
Oh, why was I tempted to roam?

I think with regret of the dear home I left,
Of the warm hearts that sheltered me there,
Of wife and dear ones, of whom I'm bereft,
For the old place again I do sigh.

Take me back to the place where the orange trees grow,
To my plot in the evergreen shade,
Where the flowers from the river's green margins did flow,
And spread their sweet scent through the glade.

Oh the path to our cottage they say has gone green,
And the place is quite lonely around,
And I know that the smiles and the forms I have seen,
Now lie in the dark mossy ground.

Take me back, let me see what is left that I knew,
Can it be that the old house is gone?
Dear friends of my childhood indeed must be few,
And I must face death all alone.

But yet I'll return to the place of my birth, 
For the children have played around the door,
Where they gathered wild blossoms that grow 'round the path,
They'll echo our footsteps no more.

Take me back to the place where my little ones sleep,
Poor Massa lies buried close by,
By the graves of the loved ones I long for to weep,
And among them to rest when I die.

Take me back to the place where I first saw the light,
To the sweet sunny south take me home,
Where the mockingbirds sing me to sleep every night,
Oh, why was I tempted to roam?
