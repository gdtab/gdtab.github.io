Emaj7   B   A

Emaj7              A           Emaj7  A  Emaj7   Bm A
Right outside this lazy summer home
Emaj7                           A              Emaj7    A Emaj7 Bm A
You ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no
A                 C#m      B                   A
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
C#m                 B                  D             A
Wonderin' where the nut-thatch winters wings a mile long
Emaj             A    Emaj7   A  Emaj7   A   C
Just carried the bird away

G                        C                       G       C
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
        G                          C                             G   C     C#  
But the heart has its beaches, its homelands and thoughts of its own
D                        C                     G                  C
Wake now, discover, that you are the song that morning brings
        G                          C                           D  Dsus4 D  Bm  A 
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

      Emaj7                A                    Emaj7  A  Emaj7   Bm  A
There comes a redeemer and he slowly too fades away
      Emaj7             A                           Emaj7   A   Emaj7  Bm  A
There follows a wagon behind him that's loaded with clay
        A                          C#m                    B     A
And the seeds that were silent all burst into bloom and decay-  ay
    Emaj7                     A                         Emaj7   A   Emaj7   A  C
And night comes so quiet it's close on the heels of the day

Emaj7                    A                  Emaj7  A  Emaj7  Bm  A
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
Emaj7                   A                        Emaj7   A   Emaj7  Bm  A
Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
A                         C#m     B                  A
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Emaj7                       A                          Emaj7   A   Emaj7   A  C
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own
