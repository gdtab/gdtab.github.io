All By Myself
?artist?

I - IV - V Blues

Little girl don't you understand,
I want to be your lover man
All by myself, all by myself
I don't want no one to love you
I want to love you all by myself

My, little girl don't you know it's true
Don't you know I'm in love with you
All by myself, all by myself
I don't want no one to love you
I want to love you all by myself

Meet me at the club at half-past one
We'll go on out and have some fun
All by ourselves, all by ourselves
We don't need no one to help us
We can do it all by ourselves

My, little girl don't you know it's true
Don't you know I'm in love with you
All by myself, all by myself
You don't need no one to love you
I'm gonna love you all by myself

Meet me at the club at half-past one
We'll go on out and have some fun
All by ourselves, all by ourselves
I don't want no one to love you
I'm gonna love you all by myself

You'll find, little girl that you know it's true
You know I'm in love with you
All by myself, all by myself
I don't want no one to love you
Gonna to love you all by myself
I don't want no one to love you
Gonna to love you all by myself
