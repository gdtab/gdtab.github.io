Senor 
(Tales of Yankee Power)
Bob Dylan
Am		Em
Senor,	Senor,
        F                C
Can you tell me where we heading?
                              Am
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
G                 F
Seems like I been down this way before
Dm                          Am
Is there any truth in that, Senor?

Senor, Senor,
Do you know where she's hiding?
How long are we gonna be riding?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Will there be any comfort here, Senor?

          C                                 E
There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck
           F                                  Am
There's an iron cross still hanging down from around her neck
          C                                    E
There's a marching band still playing in their vacant lot
          F                                      Am
Where she held me in her arms one time and said forget me not

Senor, Senor,
I can see the painted wagon
Smell the tail of a dragon
Can't stand the suspense anymore
Can you tell me who to contact here, Senor?

Well the last thing I remember before they stripped and kneeled
Was a train load of fools born down in a Magnetic field
The gypsy, where he broke a pike and a flashing ring
He say, -Son this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing-

Senor, Senor,
You know their hearts here are hard as leather
Well give me a minute, let me get it together
Just gotta pick myself up off the floor
I'm ready when you are, Senor?

Senor, Senor,
Let's overturn these tables
Disconnect these cables
This place don't make sense to me no more
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, Senor?
