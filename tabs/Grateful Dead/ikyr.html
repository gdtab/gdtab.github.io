I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone {x2}

Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms.

Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest {x2}
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West.

The Sun will shine in my back door someday. {x2}
March winds will blow all my troubles away.

I wish I was a headlight, on a North bound train {x2}
I'd shine my light through cool Colorado rain.

I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone {x2}
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms.
