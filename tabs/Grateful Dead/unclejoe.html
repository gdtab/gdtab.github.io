Uncle Joe
Traditional
Oh, ever'body come and hear my song.
I'm so God damn' old it won't take long;

I'm a-comin' ninety-two and I'll have you know
That the young folks calls me Uncle Joe.

My God damn' hair has all turn' gray,
Don't make no difference for I still feel gay;

I still step out and dance pretty good,
But I cain't seem to sing like I used to could.

But when I git out with the gals, b' gee,
I'm just about as young as I used to be.
