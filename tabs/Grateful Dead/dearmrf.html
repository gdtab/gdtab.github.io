Dear Mr. Fantasy play us a tune,
C                        G
Something to make us all happy.
 
Do anything to keep us out of this gloom
Sing a song, play guitar, make it snappy.

You are the one who makes us all glad
But doing that, you break down in tears

Please don't be sad if it was a straight life you had
We wouldn't have known you all these years.

Dear Mr. Fantasy play us a tune, something to keep us all happy.
Do anything, keep us out of this gloom
Sing a song, play guitar, make it snappy.

You are the one who can make us all glad
By doin' that you break down in tears.

Please don't be sad if it was the straight life you had
We wouldn't have known you all these years.
