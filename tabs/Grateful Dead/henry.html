Henry
J. Dawson

G                           F                G
Every year along about this time it all goes dry.
G                                F               G
Nothing 'round for love or money that'll get you high.
C                                  G
Henry got pissed off and said he'd run to Mexico.
G                                 F          G
See if he could come back holdin' 20 keys of Gold.

Now the road to Acapulco is very hard indeed
And it isn't any better if you haven't any weed.
Henry struggled to hold it straight on twisty mountain roads
Fifty people waitin' back in hopes for Henry's load.

Chorus
             D                               C           G
And now he's rolling down the mountain goin' fast, fast, fast.
    D                                  C      G
And if he blows it this one's going to be his last.
G                  C               G
Run to Acapulco to turn the Golden Key.
C              G                  F             G
Henry keep the brakes on for this corner if you please.

Jam on Verse Chords

Henry got to Mexico and turned his truck around.
Talkin' with the man who has it growin' from the ground.
Henry tasted, he got wasted, couldn't even see.
Now how he's going to drive like that it's not clear to me.

Chorus

Jam on Verse Chords

Sunday afternoon, Tijuana is a lovely town.
Bullfight brings the tourist in, their money flowing down.
Border guards are much too busy there at 5 o'clock.
Henry truckin' right on through, he hardly even stopped.
