Believe It Or Not
Garcia / Hunter
Lyrics Only

Just a few moments, just a piece of your time,
Is all I am asking, and I'll give you mine.
Just a few moments, out of all you have got,
To show how I love you, believe it or not.
To show how I love you, believe it or not.

I know I'm no angle, my prospect's alright.
As a firm mind in sorrow, when the rivers run dry.
But I roll up my shirt sleeves and give my best shot,
To show that I love you, believe it or not.
Just to show that I love you, believe it or not.

Done time in the locker, done time on the street.
Done time on the upswing, and time in defeat.
I know what I'm asking, I know it's alot,
To tell you I love you, believe it or not.
To tell you I love you, believe it or not.

Right now while the sun shines, on the crest of a hill.
With the breeze and the fire and a red whip-or-whil,
Making music together, in a word time forgot.
Let me show how I love you, believe it or not.
Let me show how I love you, believe it or not.
