Like a Road
Nix-Penn

G  Bm   C

         G   Bm        C
When the road gets too long
        G  Bm          C
And you run all out of sun
        G   G/F#  E7                  A     Dsus4   D
And the pain gets too much for you to bear
     C             G
Turn around, turn around
      B7                 C
Turn around, and I'll be there
       G            D            G     F  C   G
Like a Road, Like a Road leading home
 
When you wake up and start to cry
And you need some place to go
And you want some company that really cares
 
Turn around...
 
When the grey clouds pass you by
And the road you travel on
Doesn't seem to be goin' anywhere
 
Turn around...
