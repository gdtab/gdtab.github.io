Johnny Too Bad
artist?
Lyrics Only

Walking down the road with a pistol in your waist
Johnny you're too bad
Walking down the road with a ratchet in your waist
Johnny you're too bad

You're just robbing and stabbing and looting and shooting
Now you're too bad
You're just robbing and stabbing and looting and shooting
Now you're too bad

One of these days when you hear a voice say come
Where you gonna run to
One of these days when you hear a voice say come
Where you gonna run to

You gonna run to the rock for rescue
There will be no rock
You gonna run to the rock for rescue
There will be no rock
