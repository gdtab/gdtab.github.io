Jingle Bells
James Pierpont. publ.1857
G
Dashing through the snow 
                    C
On a one-horse open sleigh
Am                 D7
O'er the fields we go
C                G 
Laughing all the way
G                      C
Bells on bob-tail ring making spirits bright
     Am           D
What fun it is to ride and sing
  D7               G
A sleighing song tonight

    G             C             G
Oh, Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
C               G         
Oh, what fun it is to ride
     A7             D 
In a one-horse open sleigh
    G             C             G
Oh, Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
C               G         
Oh, what fun it is to ride
     D7             D 
In a one-horse open sleigh
