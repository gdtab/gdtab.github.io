G                F7  F#7  G7
Merry run around, 
G                   C  G
Sailin' up and down,
G                            C
Looking for a shot in some direction.

Got it from the top,
It's nothing you can stop,
Lord, you know they made a fire connection.

               G
They love each other.
F            C             G       F7  F#7  G7
Lord you can see that it's true,
F            C             G       F7  F#7  G7
Lord you can see that it's true, 
F            C             G      C  G
Lord you can see that it's true.

He could pass his time, 
Around some other line
But you know he choose this place beside her.

Don't get in their way, 
There's nothing you can say,
Nothing that you need to add or do.

[Chorus]   -->>  [Solo over verse and chorus]

Its' nothing, they explain, 
It's like a diesel train
You better not be there when it rolls over,

	[skip] And when that train rolls in, 
	[skip] You wonder where it's been,
	[skip] You gotta try and see a little further.

Though you make a noise, 
They just can't hear your voice,
They're on a dizzy ride and you're cold sober

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Bm                  C
If you believe that what I say is true
Em
Every song I'm singing
A                    D         A    D   A   D/D7
I've heard the words from you

Heard your news report 
Y'know you're falling short
Pretty soon won't trust you for the weather

When their ship comes in 
You won't know where it's been
Got to try to see a little farther

[Chorus]
