Gather round a corner, half a mile from here
See those long trains runnin and watch them disappear

Chorus:
Without love, where would you be (right) now
Without love

Know I saw Mrs. Lucy down along the tracks
She lost her home and her family and she won't be comin' back

Chorus

Got the Illinois Central and the Southern Central Freight
Got to keep on pushin' mama, you know they're runnin' late

Chorus

Got the Illinois Central and the Southern Central Freight
Got to keep on pushin' mama, you know they're runnin' late

Chorus

Well pistons keep on turnin and wheels go round and round
And steel rail black cold and hard and the miles as they go down

Chorus

Oh, where would you be now?

There is one other part that uses the intro chords with a different rhythm, something like this:

|  1  .  .  .  2  .  .  .  3  .  .  .   4  .  .  . |
|: Gm7         Gm7         Gm7      Gm7 Gm7   G11 :|
|  q           q           q        s   e     e    |

q - quarter note
s - sixteenth
e - eighth
