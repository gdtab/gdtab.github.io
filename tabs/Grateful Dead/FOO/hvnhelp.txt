Intro

Anything you could want to be you can buy, even get it free
Make yourself a smoother dancer, fill your head with easy answers.
Never a backward glancer, it's you who makes the rules (aah).

Heaven help the fool, heaven help the fool
No, no, never a backward glancer, (fool), heaven help the fool.
The middle of a pentagram, heart of the star (is what you are)
You can trade your soul for an electric guitar

Ooh, not a pretty vanity (no, no, not me).
Glorified insanity (no, no, not me)
And when they offer golden apples, are you sure you'll refuse?

Heaven help the fool, are you sure you'll refuse it?
Heaven help the fool
It's like a deaf man dancing or a blind man shooting pool
Heaven help the fool, heaven help the fool
