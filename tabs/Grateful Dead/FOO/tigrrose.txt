Tiger Rose
Hunter / Garcia
Lyrics Only

Tiger Rose got new clothes, the ladies love her so.
They laugh at her connections, but they don't say no.
Get down high, get down low, get your heels in tow.
We don't care what Mama don't allow here anymore.

Chorus
Tiger tea, tiger gee, you my Tiger Rose.
Gently roll me, honey, while I sing your song,
On the bank where children play ring-a-levio.
Come on and show me somethin' I don't know.

Good day breaking, windows shaking, at my cabin door.
Love me like you did last night, just one more time.
I know it don't make no sense, but then it don't intend.
If you keep coming by, we'll make it up again.

Get up, Johnny, sing along, get along now, get along.
Could be right; I may be wrong, pretty soon, be long gone.
Lay me down in worried sleep, listen to the sweet river weep.
Thought I heard it sing a song, Delta Queen done come and gone.

Chorus

Come on, big-eyed Handsome Mall, and be my doll.
We'll live in jive-o county, 'neath the waterfall.
If people say: "What would you play?"  Just tell 'em anything:
Cut-glass spur or a silver chime, can make 'em ring!

Tiger Rose, Heaven knows, I just love you so.
Maybe that's the reason, that you don't say no.
You get high, get down low.  You my rodeo.
We don't care what Mama don't allow here anymore.

Chorus

On the bank where children play ring-a-levio.
Come on show me somethin',
Come on show me somethin'
Come on and show me somethin' I don't know.
