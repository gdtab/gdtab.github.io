Shine on, glowing, 
A
Brief and brightly

Could you imagine? 
One summer day,
That same night 
Be on your way

Do you remember? 
Hearts were too cold
Seasons have frozen us 
Into our souls

People were sayin' 
The whole world is burning
Ashes were scattered 
Too hard to turn

Passenger, 
Don't you hear me?
Destination 
Seen unclearly.

What is a man 
Deep down inside,
What a raging beast 
With nothing to hide.

Upside out or inside down
False alarm, the only game in town
No man's land, the only game in town
Terrible, the only game in town
