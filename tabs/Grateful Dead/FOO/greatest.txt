Says, "You ain't got a hinge, you can't close the door."
Moses stood up a full six foot and ten
Says, "You can't close the door when the walls caved in."

I ask him for water, he poured me some wine
We finished the bottle then broke into mine.
You get what you come for, you're ready to go
And it's one in ten thousand done come for the show.

Abraham and Isaac digging on a well
Mama come quick with the water witch spell
Cool clear water well you cain't ever tell.

Moses come ridin' up on a quasar.
His spurs was a-jingling, the door was ajar.
His buckle was silver, his manner was bold.
I asked him to come on in  out of the cold.

You'd get right to work if you had any sense
You know the one thing we need is a left-handed monkey wrench.
