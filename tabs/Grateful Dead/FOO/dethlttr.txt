Death Letter Blues
Huddie Ledbetter

Got a letter this mornin'
How do you reckon' it read
Got a letter this mornin'
How do you reckon' it read

?????
The one you love is dead

Well I went to the graveyard
Look at my woman's space
Well I went to the graveyard
Look at my woman's space
I love you mama, 
I just can't take your place

Well the woman I love
She's done dead and gone
Well the woman I love
She's done dead and gone
Se left me here, 
Tryin' to sing my gravetime song.
