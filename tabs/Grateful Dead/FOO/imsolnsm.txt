C        Em       Am      C
Hear the lonesome whippoorwill
   C          Em      Gm7    C7
He sounds too blue to fly
    F        Fm6      C       Am
The midnight train is whining low
       C        G7      C
I'm so lonesome I could cry

     C     Em     Am       C
I've never seen a night so long
     C         Em       Gm7    C7
When time goes crawling by
    F         Fm6     C       Am
The moon just went behind a cloud
   C         G7       C
To hide it's face and cry

    C        Em    Am    C
Did you ever see a robin weep
     C      Em       Gm7   C7
When leaves begin to die
     F          Fm6      C       Am
That means he's lost the will to live
       C        G7      C
I'm so lonesome I could cry

    C       Em   Am       C
The silence of a falling star
       C    Em     Gm7    C7
Lights up a purple sky
    F    Fm6    C         Am
And as I wonder where you are
       C        G7      C
I'm so lonesome I could cry

I'm so lonesome I could cry

I've never seen a night so long
When time goes crawling by
The moon just went behind a cloud
To hide it's face and cry

Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves begin to die
That means he's lost the will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry

The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry
