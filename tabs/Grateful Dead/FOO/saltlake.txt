Lyrics Only

It was a paradise for lizards when young Brigham saw it first
Said, "I seen some nasty deserts Lord,
   but this one here's the worst"

The Lord just called to Brigham, said "I got a great idea.
I want a mighty city, and I think I want it here"

Salt Lake City, that town of righteousness and fame
Salt Lake City, don't sound like much, but Hell what's in a name
Nobody ever sings about it,
   but Lord I'll be going there just the same

Salt Lake City, where it's so easy keeping straight
Salt Lake City, just really makes Des Moines look second rate
Ain't makin' no big deal about it,
   but I hear them Mormon girls are really great

Salt Lake City, hey dig that Tabernacle Choir
Salt Lake City, yeah they be bound to take you higher
Just ain't no two ways about it Lord,
   yeah they really light my fire

Well Brigham kicked a prairie dog,
   and then muttered in his beard
Said "You put me through some changes Lord,
   but this one's really weird"
The Lord just laughed at Brigham,
   said "You better get to work."

The next time I check in here I want paradise on Earth
Salt Lake City

Salt Lake City, Where Brigham made the desert bloom
Salt Lake City, with a color T.V. in every room
They got them crazy Mormon chicks,
   Lord I'll be going there real soon

Salt Lake City, hey feel that magic in the air
Salt Lake City, you know, that's kinda why I like it there
Salt Lake City, you know that's where I'm bound
Salt Lake City, I'm going' down to salt lake town
