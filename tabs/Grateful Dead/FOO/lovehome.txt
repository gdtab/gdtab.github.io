As you read this letter that I write to you
     E                         B
Sweetheart, I hope you'll understand
     E                      B
That you're the only love I knew
          F#             B
Please forgive me if you can

Chorus
     B                                A
Sweetheart, I beg you to come home, tonight
E                    B
I'm so blue and all alone
  E                           B
I promise that I'll treat you right
         F#                   B
Love, oh love, oh please come home

That old wind is cold and slowly creeping 'round
And the fire is burning low
The snow has covered up the ground
Our baby's hungry, sick, and cold

That you're the only love I knew
Please forgive me if you can
