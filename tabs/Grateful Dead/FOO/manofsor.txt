Man Of Constant Sorrow
Arrangement and New Lyrics by Bob Dylan

Man of Constant Sorrow,
Ive seen trouble all my days.
Ill say goodbye to Colorado
Where I was born and partly raised.

Your mother says Im a stranger;
My face youll never see no more.
But theres one promise, darling,
Ill see you on Gods golden shore.

Through this open world Im about to ramble,
Through ice and snows, sleet and rain,
Im about to ride that mornin railroad,
Praps Ill die on that train.

Im going back to Colorado,
The place I started from.
If Id knowed how bad youd treat me,
Honey I never would have come.

Honey, if you dont think I love you
Just look what a fool I been.
And if you dont think Im sinkin
Honey, look what a hole Im in.

Its a hard, hard road to travel
When you cant be satisfied.
Ive got a rope thats hanging oer me
And the devils at my side.
