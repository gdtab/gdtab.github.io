The Women Are Smarter
Norman Span
E                         B          E

E                                                     B
Let us put men and women together to see which one is smarter
B                 
Some say the men but I say no, 
    B                        E
The women got the men like a puppet show

         E          
It ain't me, it's the people who say
                            B
Men are leading the women astray
  B  
I say it's the women today
                        E
Smarter than the man in every way.

       E
That's right the women are smarter,
       E                   B
That's right the women are smarter,
       B
That's right the women are smarter,
    B                         E
The women are smarter, that's right.

Little boy sitting in the corner and cry,
big man come and ask him why,
He said "I can't do what the big boys do",
the man sat down and he cried too.

Chorus

Ever since the world began
women been imitating the ways of men,
But listen cause I've got a plan,
give it up just don't try to understand.

Chorus
