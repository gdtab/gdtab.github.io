Money Honey
Jesse Stone

Y'know my landlord rang my front door bell
I let it ring for a long long spell
Went to the window and peeked through the blinds
And asked him to tell me what was on his mind, he said

"Money honey  money honey,
If you want to get along with me"

I told the man I was so hard pressed
I called the woman that I love best
I found my baby about a half past three
She said "I'd like to know what you want with me," I said

"Money honey  money honey
If you want to get along with me"

I'm  ???? in love with you
???? our romance is through
I said, "Tell me baby, face to face,
How could another man take my place," she said

"Money honey  money honey
If you want to stay on with me"
