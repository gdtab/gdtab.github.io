Get Out Of My Life
Allen Toussaint

Get out of my life woman, 
I don't want you no more.
Get out of my life woman, 
I don't love you no more.
Get out of my life woman, 
Nothin' but heartaches by the score.

Get out of my eyes teardrops, 
I've got to see my way around.
Get out of my eyes teardrops, 
I've got to see my way around.
Get out of my eyes teardrops, 
Nothin' but heartaches by the pound.
