Way back yonder a long time ago
Daddy had a man called cotton-eyed joe
Blew into town on a travelin' show
Nobody danced like the Cotton eyed Joe.

Chorus:
      Cotton-eyed Joe, Cotton-eyed Joe
      where did you come from?
      Where did you go?
      Where did you come from?
      Where did you go?
      Where did you come from cotton-eyed Joe?

Mama's at the window
Mama's at the door
She can't see nothin' but the Cotton-eyed Joe 

Daddy held the fiddle,
I held the bow
We beat the hell out of Cotton-eyed Joe
Chorus

Made himself a fiddle,
Made himself a bow
Made a little tune called the Cotton-Eyed Joe

Hadn't oughta been 
for the Cotton-eyed Joe
I'da been married some forty years ago.

Chorus

Whenever there's dance
All the women want to go
And they all want to dance with the Cotton-Eyed Joe
    
Daddy won't say
But I think he knows
Whatever happened to the Cotton-eyed JOe !

Chorus
Cotton-eyed Joe, Cotton-eyed Joe
Where did you come from, where did you go......
