You Can't Always Get What You Want
Jagger/Richards

  C                      F
I saw her today at the reception
C                      F
A glass of wine in her hand
  C                           F
I knew she was gonna meet her connection
        C                  F
And her feet was footloose man

    C                         F
You can't always get what you want
    C                         F
You can't always get what you want
    C                         F
You can't always get what you want
           D7                 F
But if you try sometimes, you might find
                 C            F        C     F
You get what you need

I went down to the demonstration
To get my fair share of abuse
Singin' "We're gonna vent our frustrations
If we don't, we're gonna blow a 50 amp fuse!"

You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes, you might find
You get what you need

I went down to the Chelsea drug store
To get your prescription filled
I was standin' in line with Mr. Jimmy
And man, did he look pretty ill

We decided that we would have a soda
My favorite flavor, cherry red
I was standin' in line with Mr. Jimmy
And he said one word to me, and that was "Dead"

I said to him

You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes, you might find
You get what you need

I saw her today at the reception
In her glass was a bleeding man
She was practiced at the art of deception
Well, I could tell by her blood-stained hand

You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
You can't always get what you want
But if you try sometimes, you might find
You get what you need
