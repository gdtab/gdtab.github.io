The Great Pretender
Buck Ram
Intro: 
G D B C G D G    C G

   G            D        G     G7
Oh yes, I'm the great pretender
   C                      G     G7
Pretending that I'm doing well
   C       D         G        C
My need is such I pretend too much
    G          D          G      C G
I'm lonely but no one can tell

Oh yes, I'm the great pretender
Adrift in a world of my own
I play the game but to my real shame
    G          D          G      G7
You left me to dream all alone

    C                       G
Too real is this feeling of make-believe
    C                        G              D7
Too real when I feel when my heart can't conceive

Oh, yes, I'm the great pretender
Just laughing and gay like a clown
I seem to be what I'm not you'll see
    G          D            B     C
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
   G            D             G
Pretending that you're still around

Instrumental

Too real is this feeling of make believe
Too real when I feel when my heart can't conceive

Oh, yes, I'm the great pretender
Just laughing and gay like a clown
I seem to be what I'm not you'll see
    G          D            B      C
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
   G            D             B     C       G  D  G
Pretending that you're still around
