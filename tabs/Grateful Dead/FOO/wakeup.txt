The movie wasn't so hot, 
   G           D         G
It didn't have much of a plot

   G
We fell asleep, 
    G
Our goose is cooked, 
    G
Our reputation is shot
               A       G
Wake up little Susie, 
               A
Wake up little Susie

What are you gonna tell your mama, 
A
What you gonna tell your papa
A             
What are you gonna tell our friends when they say 
A
"ooo la la"

Wake up little Susie,

Wake up little Susie

Well I told your mama that you'd be in by ten
    G         
Now Susie, baby looks like we goofed again
               A       G
Wake up little Susie, 
               A       G
Wake up little Susie, 
            D
We gotta go home

Wake up little Susie, wake up. 
Wake up little Susie, wake up.
We both fell sound asleep, 
Wake up little Susie and weep
The movie's over
It's four o'clock 
And we're in trouble deep
Wake up little Susie, wake up little Susie
