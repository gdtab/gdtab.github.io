See that girl, barefootin' along,
G                                       D
Whistlin' and singin', she's a carryin' on.
D                                            C6
There's laughing in her eyes, dancing in her feet,
        F          C                   G           D
She's a neon-light diamond and she can live on the street.

Hey hey, hey, come right away
G                             D
Come and join the party every day.

Well everybody's dancin' in a ring around the sun
Nobody's finished, we ain't even begun.
So take off your shoes, child, and take off your hat.
Try on your wings and find our where it's at.

Hey hey, hey, come right away
Come and join the party every day.

Take a vacation, fall out for a while,
Summer's comin' in, and it's goin' outa style
Well, lie down smokin', honey, have yourself a ball
Your mother's down in Memphis, won't be back 'till the fall.

Hey hey, hey, come right away
Come and join the party every day.
