C                       
Take it, you can have it, 
F
What I got baby, I can't hold
G                     
And if you find the secret 
C
Tell me how to build the mold.

And I can't handle your problems 
So don`t try to handle mine,
Get yourself a shotgun, a pocketful of shells
And we can while away the time.

Am
Look up the wall, 
C
Do it right, 
Am
Make a mistake,
                C
You're going to pay for it twice,
           Am
But if you need it, 
       C
Got to have it 
G
Get yourself a shotgun and bring it back home

C
Look up the wall, 
Am
You know you got to call
F
before you start falling, get ready to fall.
G
And if you fall in my direction
        F               C
Don't expect no help at all....don't

Get it right, 
Do it nice
And if you make a mistake, 
You're going to pay for it twice,
but if you need it, got to have it 
Get yourself a shotgun and bring it back home

Look up the wall, 
You know you got to call
But if you start falling, be ready to fall,
And if you fall in my direction
Don't expect no help at all, 
Don't expect no help at all,
Don't expect no help at all, 

And if you fall in my direction
Don't expect no help at all
