E                          D        A      E  D  A
Well I told you once and I told you twice
E                       D    A     E  D  A 
But you never listen to my advice
E                  D       A         E  D  A 
You don't try very hard to please me
E                    D         A    E  D  A
For what you know it should be easy

A                      
Well this could be the last time
A                 
This could be the last time
D                             A
Maybe the last time I don't know
   E     D  A
Oh no

Well I'm sorry girl but I can't stay
Feelin' like I do today
There's too much pain and too much sorrow
Guess I'll feel the same tomorrow

Well I told you once and I told you twice
Someone'll have to pay the price
Here's a chance to change your mind
Cause I'll be gone a long, long time

E          D    A     
May be the last time ( Repeat )  No  No  No
