Intro	D - Dsus4 repeat

D                     Dsus4
It's so easy to slip
D               A  G  D
It's so easy to fall
G                                       D
Let your memory drift and do nothin' at all
        G                      Gsus  (x x 0 0 1 3)
All the love that you missed
            G
And all the people that you can't recall
G                       D  A  G   D  A  G
Do they really exist at all?

          D           C(9)     G           C     G
Well, the whole world seems so cold today
                          D   (A  G)
And all the magic's gone away
        D      C(9)          G           C  G    
And our time together melts away
         G            D  A  G   D  A  G
Like the sad melody I play.

It's so easy to fall

All the love that you missed
G
And all the people that you can't recall
G                       D    A  G    D  A  G
Do they really exist at all?         

        D             C(9)    G      C   G
Well, I don't want to live forever
                              D   (A  G)
In the shadow of your leaving me
        D      C(9)           G           C  G
So I'll light another (mellow) cigarette
    G                     D   A  G     D  A  G
And try to remember to forget.

It's so easy to slip - It's so easy to fall
