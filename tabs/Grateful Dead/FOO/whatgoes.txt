What Goes Around
Rebbenach
Dm   A7

Dm
Remember way back when
A7
You had a yen
F                 G
To mess over your old friend
A7               
You know, you dragged me to your heart
Bb
With your smilin' grin
G
You'll never get a chance like that
   C
To pull that old stuff again

F    (A)   Bb     F  (A) Bb
What goes around, comes around
F    (A)   Bb     F  (A) Bb
What goes around, comes around
        A7                                     Dm   A7  Dm
And the way it goes up, that's the way it goes down

Dm   A7  Dm

Now, I done got over
It won't bother me no more
And the way that I met you
I'll meet a million more
I'm so glad, the way I feel
You've come out on the short end
     C                A7	Dm
Of a dirty, dirty deal

You keepin' an eye peeled
Over your shoulder
Life's not gettin' any younger
It's gettin' older and older
You keep tryin' 
To be a little bolder
You know, life might sometimes treat
Just a little colder and colder

What goes around, comes around
What goes around, comes around
And the way it goes up, that's the way it goes down
