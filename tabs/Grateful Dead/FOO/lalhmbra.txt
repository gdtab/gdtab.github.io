Lyrics Only

 l'Alhambra
Six guitars
Each plays
a different tune

Five play slowly
One plays quick,
in Allegrias
in clear moon	

Eight hands clap
to summon up
the Tarantelle -
Beware!	

Yo no he bailado
con su hija ya
I have not danced
with your sister yet	

L'Alhambra
Five guitars
play at once -
together now	

One has gone
into the shadow
Gone with him
is his guitar

Six hands clap
Two are gone now
Captured by
the Tarantelle

Someone else
must play guitar
when time comes
for making love

No he bailado desde
Las Zapatas son perdidas
I have not danced
since my shoes were lost

Yo no he bailado
con su hija
No he bailado desde
Hey que no baile	

Yo no he bailado
con su hija ya
No he bailado desde
Hey que no baile

I have not danced
with your sister yet
Is that she who
sleeps by my guitar?
