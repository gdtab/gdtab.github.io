Dynamite
E. Walker/A. Savoy/L. Hamilton
Come on y'all
I think the time is right
So let's get down with the groove
The music's out of sight

What it is, everybody
You dig where I'm comin' from
This feelin' hit me by surprise
I'm ready to have some fun

This feelin' hit me
Hit me before I knew it
Now I got myself together
There really ain't nothin' to it

Well I feel alright y'all
Now I feel like dynamite
Well I feel alright y'all
Now I feel like dynamite

Watch me y'all,
I ain't jokin'
Watch me y'all
Let's smoke it

I can do anything you want to do
betcha
You can sing anything you want to sing
betcha
I think you'll find you agree with me
Outta sight
When I get to doin' my thing,
I feel like dynamite


This feelin' hit me
Hit me before I knew it
Now I got myself together
There really ain't nothin' to it

Well I feel alright y'all
Now I feel like dynamite
Well I feel alright y'all
Now I feel like dynamite
