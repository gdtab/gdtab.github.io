D            Am         Em           C                G
Look out of any window, any morning, any evening, any day.
D           Am            Em
Maybe the sun is shining, birds are winging,
   G                      A
No rain is falling from a heavy sky.
D           G                 Am            Em      D
What do you want me to do, to do for you to see you through?
    C               D                  Am               G
For this is all a dream we dreamed one afternoon, long ago.

D            Am          Em
Walk out of any doorway, feel your way, 
     C                       G
Feel your way like the day before.
D            Am
Maybe you'll find direction,
 Em                      G                    A
Around some corner where it's been waiting to meet you.
D            G
What do you want me to do, 
   Am                          Em   D
To watch for you while you are sleeping?
     Am                       C          G               D
Then please don't be surprised when you find me dreaming too.

D         Am       Em            C
Look into any eyes you find by you, 
                             G
You can see clear to another day,
D          Am
Maybe been seen before, 
        Em            G                      A
Through other eyes on other days while going home.
D               G             Am            Em      D
What do you want me to do, to do for you to see you through?
     C              Em               D           G
It's all a dream we dreamed one afternoon, long ago.

D              Am
Walk into splintered sunlight,
Em                    C                      G
Inch your way through dead dreams to another land.
D            Am    
Maybe you're tired and broken,
     Em                     G          
Your tongue is twisted with words half spoken 
    A
And thoughts unclear
D               G             Am            Em      D
What do you want me to do, to do for you to see you through?
  Am               C
A box of rain will ease the pain, 
    G                 D
And love will see you through.

G                   Am       Em
Just a box of rain, wind and water,
  C                A                D   
Believe it if you need it, if you don't, just pass it on
G               Am       Em
Sun and shower, wind and rain,
C                 D          Em            A
In and out the window like a moth before a flame.

         D                Em          G                D
And it's just a box of rain, I don't know who put it there,
                  Bm           G               A
Believe it if you need it, or leave it if you dare.
         D                Em        G             D
And it's just a box of rain, or a ribbon for tour hair;
        Em              
Such a long long time to be gone, 
        G                D     C  G  D  Asus4
And a short time to be there.
