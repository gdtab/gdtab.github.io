Slow Train
Bob Dylan 
Am
Sometimes 
I feel so low-down and disgusted
               Dm
Can't help but wonder 
                          Am
what's happenin' to my companions

Are they lost or are they found, 
have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
All their earthly principles 
They're gonna have to abandon?

Chorus:
              F                Dm                   Am
And there's a slow, slow train comin' up around the bend.

I had a woman 
Down in Alabama,
She was a backwoods girl, 
But she sure was realistic,
She said, "Boy, without a doubt, 
Have to quit your mess and straighten out,
You could die down here, 
Be just another accident statistic."

All that foreign oil 
Controlling American soil,
Look around you, 
It's just bound to make you embarrassed.
Sheiks walkin' around like kings, 
Wearing fancy jewels and nose rings,
Deciding America's future 
From Amsterdam and to Paris

Man's ego is inflated, 
His laws are outdated, 
They don't apply no more,
You can't rely no more 
To be standin' around waitin'
In the home of the brave, 
Jefferson turnin' over in his grave,
Fools glorifying themselves, 
Trying to manipulate Satan

Big-time negotiators, 
False healers and woman haters,
Masters of the bluff,
Masters of the proposition
But the enemy I see 
Wears a cloak of decency,
All non-believers and men stealers 
Talkin' in the name of religion

People starving and thirsting 
Grain elevators are bursting
You know it costs more to store the food 
Than it does to give it.
They say lose your inhibitions
Follow your own ambitions,
They talk about a life of brotherly love, 
Show me someone who knows how to live it.

Well, my baby went to Illinois 
With some bad-talkin' boy she could destroy
A real suicide case, 
But there was nothin' I could do to stop it,
I don't care about economy
I don't care about astronomy
But it's sure to bother me to see 
My loved ones turning into puppets
