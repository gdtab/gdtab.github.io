I'll Be Your Baby Tonight
Bob Dylan

           F
Close your eyes, close the door
                  G           G7
You don't have to worry any more
Bb          C         F         C
I'll be your baby tonight

Shut the light, shut the shade
You don't have to be afraid
I'll be your baby tonight

Bridge:
             Bb
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away
F
We're gonna forget it
      G
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon
      C
But we're gonna let it, you won't regret it

Kick your shoes off, do not fear
Bring that bottle over here
I'll be your baby tonight
