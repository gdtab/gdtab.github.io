E7
I need a woman 'bout twice my age,
A lady of nobility, gentility and rage --
A splendor in the dark -- lightnin' on the draw.
We'll go right through the book, 
And break each and every law.

        A5                                  E7
I got a feeling, and it won't go away.  oh, no.
B
Just one thing, then I'll be okay.
E7
I need a miracle every day.

I need a woman 'bout twice my height --
Statuesque, raven-tressed, a goddess of the night
With a secret incantation, candles burning blue.
We consult the spirits.
Maybe they'll know what to do.

And it's real, and it won't go away.  Oh, no.
Can't get around it, and I can't run away.
I need a miracle every day.

I need a woman 'bout twice my weight --
A ton of fun, who packs a gun with all that other freight.
Find her in a sideshow.  Leave her in L.A.
Ride her like a surfer riding on a tidal wave.

And it's real.  Believe what I say, oh yeah.
Just one thing that I got to say:
I need a miracle every day.

A(?B)
It takes dynamite to get me up.
E7
Too much of everything is just enough.
A(?B)
One more thing:  I just got to say,
E7
I need a miracle every day!
G7
I need a miracle every day

I need a miracle every day (I must have a miracle).
I need a miracle every day (some kind of miracle).
I need a miracle, I need a miracle.
I need a miracle every day (I need a miracle).
I need a miracle every day (some kind of miracle).
I need a miracle every day (got to have a miracle).
I need a miracle, I need a miracle.
