G    C
F  F#  G (x3)
    C              D
You tell me you're lonely
  Bm            Em
I know how you feel
        C         D
Leaning up at the bones
        Bm         Em
Rocking back on my heels
        C              D
She's a wild bird that wandered
    G         Em
Too easy, too stray
  C               D
I knew she had to lose me
   Bm           Cmaj7/E
To find her own way

Em         C              G
Oh, curry*, I'll be coming soon

Through the Lou'siana pines to the Mississippi moon
            G     G7  C            F    F#     G
Through the Lou'siana pines to the Mississippi moon

A wave on the ocean
A whirlwind on the sea
I took a notion
That her ship would not ?wave?
So light me a candle 
In the forest so deep
Honey, lay down beside me 
Angels rock us to sleep

Oh, curry, I'll be coming soon
Through the Lou'siana pines to the Mississippi moon
Through the Lou'siana pines to the Mississippi moon
