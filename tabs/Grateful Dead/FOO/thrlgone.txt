The Thrill Is Gone
R. Hawkins
Bm
The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone away
Em                                Bm
The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone away
G                            F#
You know you done me wrong baby, 
              Bm
And you'll be sorry someday

The thrill is gone, it's gone away from me
The thrill is gone, it's gone away from me
Although I'll still live on,
But so lonely I'll be

The thrill is gone, it's gone away for good
The thrill is gone, it's gone away for good
Someday I know I'll be over it all
Just like I know a good man should

You know I'm free, free, now, I'm free from your spell
You know I'm free, free, now, I'm free from your spell
And know that it's all over
All I can do is wish you well
