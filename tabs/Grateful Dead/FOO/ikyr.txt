I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone {x2}
      F         C          F       C  Em   D
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms.

Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest {x2}
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West.

The Sun will shine in my back door someday. {x2}
March winds will blow all my troubles away.

I wish I was a headlight, on a North bound train {x2}
I'd shine my light through cool Colorado rain.

I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone {x2}
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms.

Additional Verses:
I'd rather drink muddy water, sleep in a hollow log {x2}
Then stay here in 'Frisco, be treated like a dog

I know you rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone, {x2}
Gonna miss your little momma, from a-rolling in your arms.

I'm goin' down the road where I can get more decent care, {x2}
Goin back to my used-to-be rider, 'cause I don't feel welcome here.

I know my baby sure is bound to love me some, {x2}
'Cause he throws his arms around me, like a circle 'round the sun.

I'm goin down to the river, set in my rocking chair, {x2}
And if the blues don't find me, gonna rock away from here.

Lovin' you baby, just as easy as rollin' off a log, {x2}
But if I can't be your woman, I sure ain't gonna be your dog.

I will cut your wood, baby, I will make your fire, {x2}
And I will tote your water, baby, from that Fresno Bar.

Sun gonna shine in my back yard some day, {x2}
And the wind gonna rise up, baby, blow my blues away.
