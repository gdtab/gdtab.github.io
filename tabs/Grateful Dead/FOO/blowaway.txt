Blow Away
Mydland / Barlow

  Ab          Eb                   Bb
A man and a woman come together as strangers.
Ab                     Eb                Bb
When they part they're usually strangers still.
It's like a practical joke played on us by our Maker.
Empty bottles that can't be filled.

Chorus:
Cm                 Bb             Eb                       F
Baby, who's to say it coulda' been different now that it's done.
(Baby, who's to say)
Baby, who's to say that it shoulda' been anyway.
(Baby, who's to say)
Baby, who's to say that it even matters in the long run.
(Baby, who's to say)
Cm                   Bb                   F Gm F Gm Cm F
Give me just a minute and it'll blow away

You fancy me to be the Master of your feelings.
You barely bruise me with your looks to kill.
Though I admit we were sometimes brutal in our dealings,
I never held you against your will.

Chorus

Your case against me is so very clearly stated
I plead no contest, I just turn and I shrug.
I've come to figure all importance overestimated.
You must mean water when you beg for blood.

Chorus

Outro:
F        Cm Bb       Eb           F
Blow away     Like a feather in a whirlwind, 
Blow away     Just as surely as the world spins
Blow away, it'll blow away blow away, oh it'll blow away
Bb   F                 Bb   F
Give it just a minute, give it just a minute now.
