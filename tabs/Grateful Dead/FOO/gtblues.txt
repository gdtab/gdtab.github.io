Good Times Blues 
(Never Trust A Woman)

D   
I see some good times, I gotta get to ring that bell
                 G
I gotta see some good times
                                       D
Sometimes you make up for when I'm not feeling well
                       A
It must be due to some great times
                            D       G    A
Cause right now I feel like hell

D                         
Never trust a woman who wears her pants too tight
G                                                  D
Never trust a woman who wears her pants too tight
A
She might love you tomorrow, 
              G             D          G   A
But she'll be gone tomorrow night

Come tomorrow I'll get my pay to leave this town
Come tomorrow I'll get my pay to leave this town
She don't really love me
Ain't no reason to stick around

I see some good times, I gotta get to ring that bell
I gotta see some good times
Sometimes you make up for when I'm not feeling well
It must be due to some great times
Cause right now I feel like hell

Must be due some great times,
But if they never come around,
Oh, oh what the, if they never, come around,
Never, never ever, ever, ever, come around,
Oh, what the hell.
