Walking The Dog
Rufus Thomas
Lyrics Only

Baby's back all dressed in black.  Silver buttons all down her back
High ho tip the toes, she broke the needle now she can't sew

Walking the dog, I'm just a walking the dog
If you don't know how to do it, I'll show you how to walk that dog

Mary, Mary, quite contrary, how does your garden grow
With silver bells and cockle shells and pretty maids all in a row

I asked my mother for fifteen cents, I see her ever I jump the fence
I jumped the sky I touched the sky,
Never come down 'till the fourth of July
