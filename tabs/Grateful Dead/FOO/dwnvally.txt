Down In The Valley
Traditional

Roses love sunshine, violets love dew
Angels in heaven, know I love you
Know I love you, love, know I love you
Angels in heaven, know I love you

If you don't love me, love who you please
Throw your arms around me, give my heart ease
Give my heart ease, love, give my heart ease
Throw your arms around me, give my heart ease

Build me a castle, forty feet high
So I can see her, as she rides by
As she rides by, love, as she rides by
So I can see her, as she rides by

Write me a letter, send it by mail
Send it in care of the Birmingham jail
Birmingham jail, love, Birmingham jail
Send it in care of the Birmingham jail

Down in the valley, valley so low
Hang your head over, hear the wind blow
Hear the wind blow, love, hear the wind blow
Hang your head over, hear the wind blow
