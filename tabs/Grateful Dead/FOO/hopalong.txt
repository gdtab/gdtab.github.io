Hopalong Peter
Traditional 
Arr. J. Garcia & D. Grisman

D
Old Uncle Peter, he got tight
                         A
Started up to heaven one stormy night
    D                    G
The road being rough and him not well
   A
He lost, his way and he went to ...

Chorus:
D      
Hopalong Peter where you goin'?
                         A
Hopalong Peter where you goin'?
D                        G
Hopalong Peter won't you bear in mind
  A                                     D
I ain't comin' back 'til the gooseberry time.

Old mother Hubbard and her dog were Dutch
A bow-legged rooster and he hobbled on a crutch
The hen chewed tobacco and the duck drank wine
The goose played the fiddle on the pumpkin vine.

Chorus

Down in the barn yard playin' seven up
The old tomcat and the little yellow pup 
The old mother Hubbard she's a pickin' out the fleas
The rooster in the cream jar up to his knees.

Chorus

I've got a sweet gal in this old town
If she weighs an ounce she weighs 700 pounds 
Every time my sweet gal turns once around 
The heels of her shoe make a hole in the ground.

Chorus
