Down The Road

Down the road to Union Station running through the fog
I thought I saw Joe Hill last night grinning like a dog
"I understand they did you in for everyone to see"
He smiled - shook his head - "that's a lie," said he
"I been on a mountain top observing from a cloud
Been in the hearts of workers milling with the crowd
My tears are shed for freedom and equality of means
My blood and perspiration oil the gears of your machines"

Down the road again
Down the road again

Down the road to Massachusetts driving through the night
I thought I saw Jack Kennedy hitchhiking by a light
I hit the brakes - backed up slow, and Kennedy got in
I said, "It's nice to see you lookin' back in shape again
Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe they gunned you down"
He just shook his head & looked off sadly with a frown
Said, "bullets are like waves they only rearrange the sand
History turns upon the tides & not the deeds of man"

Down the road again
Down the road again

Driving down to Fiddler's Green to hear a tune or two
I thought I saw John Lennon there, looking kind of blue
I sat down beside him, said: "thought you bought the store"
He said: "I heard that rumor, what can I do you for?"
"Have you written anything I might have never heard?"
He picked up his guitar and strummed a minor third
All I can recall of what he sang, for what it's worth:
"Long as songs of mine are sung I'm with you on this earth"

Down the road again
Down the road again

>From  the corner of my eye I saw the sun explode
I didn't look directly 'cause it would have burned my soul
When the smoke and thunder cleared enough to look around
I heard a sweet guitar lick, an odd familiar sound
(I) heard a laugh I recognized come rolling from the earth.
Saw it rise into the skies like lightning giving birth
I sounded like Garcia but I couldn't see the face
Just the beard and the glasses and a smile on empty space

Down the road again
Down the road again
