I'm The Jealous Kind
?artist?

Girl, don't be angry if I seem rude
It's time we meet
A boy that you once knew
I treated you so... ...used to be so close to you

It's just that I'm so afraid
Someone might steal you away
I'd lose my mind
So please forgive the way I act sometimes
Because I'm the jealous kind

If you only knew where I lived
And didn't mind
See, can't you see, I'll tell you my dreams
And I'll lose my mind

I want you all to myself
I don't want you shaggin' with nobody else
I can't help the way I act sometimes
Because I'm the jealous kind

Just one more thing now,
If you only knew 
How much it hurts me just to hear you say
How ... when we first met
I can't think that those were the good old days

Why must you hurt me so
I can't stand it no more
I'm tryin'
So ... please ... 
I can't control these tears in my eyes
'Cause I'm the jealous kind

I love you baby...
You know you've got me baby...

You know I'm the jealous kind...
