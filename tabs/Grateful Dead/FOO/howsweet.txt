I needed the shelter  of someone's arms and there you were
G                        Em                         D             C7
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs and there you were
G                   C7       G                   C7
With sweet love and devotion deeply touching my emotion
               G               C7
I want to stop - and thank you baby
               G               G    Riff
I want to stop - and thank you baby

Chorus

I close my eyes at night, 
	Wonderin' where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was such a bore,
	Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
But you brightened up for me all of my days
	With a love so sweet and in so many ways
I want to stop - and thank you baby
I just want to stop - and thank you baby

Chorus

Chorus

How sweet it is to be loved by you
(Sweeter than the honey from the bees, baby)
How sweet it is to be loved by you
(Yes it is, you know it is, darling)
