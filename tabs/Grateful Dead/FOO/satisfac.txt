  Satisfaction
         E          B7
And I try, and I try,
         E          A
And I try, and I try.

(with riff)
        E       
I cant get no
        E       
I cant get no

          E            
When Im driving in my car
          E                
And that man comes on the radio
          E                   
And he's tellin' me more and more
           E             
About some useless information
             E            
Supposed to fire my imagination
         E         
I can't get no
           tacet
Oh no, no, no
         E       
Hey, hey, hey
              E       
That's what I say

Chorus

When I'm watching my T.V.
And a man comes on and tells me
How white my shirts could be
But he cant be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me
I cant get no,
No, no, no.

Chorus

When I'm riding 'round the world
And I'm doing this and I'm signing that
And I'm trying to meet some girl
Who tells me, "Baby better come back maybe next week,
Can't you see I'm on a losin' streak"
I cant get no,
No, no, no.

I cant get no.....
