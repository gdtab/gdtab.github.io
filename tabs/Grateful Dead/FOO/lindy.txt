Oh Mama, how can it be?
You went way across the sea
Just to keep from doing that Lindy thing with me
(Oh baby, well I done just told'ja now)

Oh Mama, don't you weep and moan,

I asked her for a piece of banana
She said, "Let me play the blues on your piano
And then I'll do that Lindy thing with you."
(Mary had a dream about a submarine.)

I asked her for a glass of K-ola
She said, "Let me play the blues on your Victrola,
And then I'll do that Lindy thing with you."
