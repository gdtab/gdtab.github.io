                 F#m     E   D
Too late to feel sorrow, 
                 Bm     A    G
Too late to feel pain
                     Bm
Now he's just an old hobo 
A        Asus4      A
Lost out in the rain
                  F#m      E   D
He'll never cause trouble, 
                 Bm      A   G
So don't have no fear
                 Bm
He's just an old hobo, 
          A       Asus4         A
And he'll soon be far away from here

C#                           D             Dsus4  D
He used to be a gambling man just like you
         A                      
Until he sank so low that there was 
E                         Asus4    A
Nothin' that no one could do

Oh, don't make him ask you, 
Don't make him beg
He was a war hero 
And that's how he hurt his leg
Well, killed thirty 'injuns, 
With one cannon ball
Now he's just an old hobo 
Asleep out in the hall

A wife and five children 
Who live in L.A.
Oh, they miss their dear daddy 
Who's gone so far away
They still have his picture, 
It's a-hung on the wall
Now he's just an old hobo 
Asleep out in the hall
