A                        D    A
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming, 
A         G         E         A
heads all empty and I don't care.
A           C#m         F#m
Saw my baby down by the river,
E                        D           A        E   A
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air.

A                                D  A
Sweet blossom come on, under the willow,
A           G             E            A
We can have high times if you'll abide.
A                   C#m        F#m
We can discover the wonders of nature,
E                     D           A             E   A
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside.

D              G       D      
She's got everything delightful, 
D               A      D
she's got everything I need.
D                    G          D
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double,
D              E      A 
Pays my ticket when I speed.

A                                   D  A
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet.
A        G         E       A
She can wade in a drop of dew.
A                  C#m     F#m
She don't come and I don't follow,
E                     D         A   
Waits backstage while I sing to you.


A                      D     A
Well, she can dance a Cajun rhythm,
A           G         E          A
Jump like a Willys in four-wheel drive.
A                          C#m              F#m
She's a summer love in the spring, fall and winter;
E                  D        A    
She can make happy any man alive.

A        G     D  A
Sugar Magnolia,      
A            G        D  A
ringing that bluebell,
A            G        D  A
Caught up in sunlight.      
A           E            G               D
Come on out singing I'll walk you in the sunshine
D                                    A      E   A
Oooh, come on honey, come along with me.

She's got everything delightful, 
she's got everything I need,
A breeze in the pines and the summer night moonlight,
Crazy in the sunlight, yes indeed.

A                            D  A
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying, 
A        G       E        A
When the moon is half way down,
B                   E        B
Sometimes when the night is dying,
B                    A      E     D    A    E   B
I take me out and I wander around,
        A      E  B
I walk around.

B            E         B F#             E
The sunshine daydream,  walking in the tall trees.
B                E         B F# E               B
Going where the wind goes,     blooming like a red rose.
E              B      F# E          B
Breathing more freely.   Ride out singing,

I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
F#        E
Sunshine, daydream.
B         E
Sunshine, daydream
