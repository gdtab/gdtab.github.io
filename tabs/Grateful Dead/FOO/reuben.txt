Cérise was brushing her long hair gently down
                B       F#    E                    B      F#
It was the afternoon of carnival as she brushes it gently down
B          F#            E       B    F#
Reuben was strumming his painted mandolin
                     B      F#      E
It was inlaid with a pretty face in jade 
              B    F#    E
Played in the carnival parade

Cérise was dressing as Pirouette in white
When a fatal vision gripped her tight Cérise beware tonight
Reuben, Reuben tell me truly true
I feel afraid and I don't know why I do, 
	Is there another girl for you?

If you could see in my heart    you would know it's true
B              E      B         A     A   Asus4  A
There's none Cérise, except for you, 
           G#    s.n.   C   C#  D#
Except for you
    C#m         B     F#   B                     F#        E
I'd swear to it on my very soul, If I lie, may I fall down cold

When Reuben played on his painted mandolin
The breeze would pause to listen in before going its way again
Masquerade began when nightfall finally woke
Like waves against the bandstand, 
	dancers broke to the painted mandolin

Looking out on the crowd who was standing there
Sweet Ruby Claire at Reuben stared, at Reuben stared
She was dressed as Pirouette in red
And her hair hung gently down

The crowd pressed round, Ruby stood as though alone
Reuben's song took on a different tone and he played it just for her
The song that he played was the carnival parade
Each note cut a thread of Cérise's fate it cut through like a blade


Reuben was playing his painted mandolin
When Ruby froze and turned to stone for the strings played all alone
The voice of Cérise from the face of the mandolin
Singing Reuben, Reuben tell me true for I have no one but you

C#m                    F#    E            B               Bsus4  B
If you could see in my heart    you would know it's true
B              E      B         A     A   Asus4  A
There's none Cérise, except for you, 
           G#    s.n.   C   C#  D#
Except for you
    C#m         B     F#   B                     F#        E
I'd swear to it on my very soul, If I lie, may I fall down cold

Ahoy! Old ferryman, Riverboat of Charon ride, though alive, 
Take Reuben to the other side, for his sweet Cérise has died
Its a lonely walk from hell to the burying ground, Cérise may return
But don't you look around ,for your glance would cut her down.

The truth of love an unsung song must tell
The course of love must follow blind without a look behind
Reuben walked the streets of New Orleans till dawn
Cérise so lightly in his arms and her hair hung gently down
