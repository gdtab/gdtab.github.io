Rollin' And Tumblin'
M. Morganfield (Muddy Waters)
Lyrics Only

Well I roll and a-tumble,
I cried the whole night long. (2x)
Well I had the feelin', baby,
Somethin's goin' on wrong.

Well I really love you, baby,
Come on and say you'll be mine.  (2x)
Well, if you don't like my taters,
Don't you trip (?) my vine.

Well I cried last night, mama,
I cried the night before.  (2x)
Well I had the feelin', baby,
You don't love me no more.

Well if the river was whiskey,
I was a diving duck.  (2x)
Well I would swim to the bottom,
Baby, I wouldn't come up.

Well I roll and a-tumble,
I cried the whole night long.  (2x)
Well I had the feelin', baby,
Somethin's goin' on wrong.
