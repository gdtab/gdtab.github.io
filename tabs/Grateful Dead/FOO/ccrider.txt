Well you made me love you woman, 
D                A7        E7
Now your man has come.

So I'm goin' away now baby 
And I won't be back till fall,
I'm goin' away now baby 
And I won't be back till fall,
Just might find me a good girl 
Might not be comin' back at all.

Well now see, C. C. Rider, 
See now the moon is shining bright,
Well now see, C. C. Rider, 
See now the moon is shining bright,
Just might find me that good girl 
And everything would be alright.

EASY RIDER (C.C.RIDER)

Easy rider, see what you done done, Lawd, Lawd,
Easy rider, see what you done done,
Easy rider, see what you done done,
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Made me love you, now yo' man done come, Lawd, Lawd,
Made me love you, now yo'man done come,
Made me love you, now yo'man done come,
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

When you see me comin', h'ist yo' windows high, Lawd, Lawd,
When you see me comin', h'ist yo' windows high,
When you see me comin', h'ist yo' windows high,
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

When you see me leavin', hang yo' head an' cry, Lawd, Lawd,
When you see me leavin', hang yo' head an' cry,
When you see me leavin', hang yo' head an' cry,
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

If I was a headlight on some western train, Lawd, Lawd,
I'd shine my light on cool Colorado Springs,
I'd shine my light on cool Colorado Springs,
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

I'm goin' to the nation and the territo', Lawd, Lawd,
Tryin' to fin' a honey gal I know,
Tryin' to fin' a honey gal I know,
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

If I was a catfish swimmin' in the deep blue sea, Lawd, Lawd,
I'd keep those women from fussin' over me,
I'd keep those women From fussin' over me,
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Note: Often sung with two repeated lines, followed by a rhyming third line (2 lines from verse 1, tag line from verse 2). "Hey hey etc." sometimes omitted. One can insert "floater" verses from just about any standard blues (i.e. Don' like my peaches, don' shake my tree etc.)
