Born On The Bayou
John Fogerty/CCR

The intro riff is just arpeggios based on this fingering
for an E7 chord: x7675x

The chords are basically just E7, with your occasional D -> A change thrown in.  Lyrics, as best as I can remember 'em 25 years later:

When I was just a little boy
A-standin' to my daddy's knee
My papa said, "son, don't let the man getcha
And do what he done to me"

And I can remember the Fourth of July
A-runnin' through the backwoods bare
And I can still hear that old hound dog barkin'
Chasin' down a hoodoo there

Born on the bayou...
Wish I was back on the bayou
A-rollin' with some Cajun queen
Wish I was on a fast freight train
Just a-chooglin' on down to New Orleans
