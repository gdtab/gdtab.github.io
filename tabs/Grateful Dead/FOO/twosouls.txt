What is the secret 
Of this tie that binds?
Two souls in communion, 
Both body and mind.
Is it special magic, 
Or just the nature of things?
Conceived of great spirit, 
Not for beggars or kings.

You who have found it 
Please help me along.
I'm a man, I'm a man,
I'm not made out of stone.
My needs they are simple, 
I don't want many things,
But I surely want to ride on them wings of love
One more time.

The improv just goes on the following pattern
