I Shall Be Released
Bob Dylan
E                            F#m
They say everything can be replaced,
G#m        F#m      B      E
that every distance is not near
E                   F#m
So I remember every face,
G#m      F#m       B      E
of every man who's put me here

Chorus
  E                 F#m
I see my light come shining,
G#m      F#m    B      E
from the west unto the east
E            F#m
Any day now, any way now,
G#m F#m B    E
I shall be reelased

E                           F#m
They say every man needs protection,
G#m        F#m      B        E
that every man must rise and fall
E                      F#m
Yet I swear I see my reflection,
G#m          F#m   B         E
somewhere so high above this wall

Chorus

E                           F#m
Yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
G#m       F#m         B      E
a man who swears he's not to blame
E                       F#m
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
G#m         F#m      B      E
he's crying out that he was framed

Chorus

I    shall be released.
