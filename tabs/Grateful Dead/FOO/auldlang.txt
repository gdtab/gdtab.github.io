Auld Lang Syne
Robert Burns

Play with a wah and very heavy distortion; it sounds cool, really.
       F                C7
Should old acquaintance be forgot
    F                Bb
And never brought to mind
      F                C7
Should old acquaintance be forgot
A   Dm   Gm7     C7   F
And days of auld lang syne

For auld lang syne, my dear,
For auld lang syne,
We'll take a cup o'kindness yet
And days of auld lang syne

The original poem has another verse, but nobody ever sings it.
