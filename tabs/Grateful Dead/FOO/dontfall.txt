Don't Fall Apart On Me Tonight
Bob Dylan
C      Em               F
Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl
C      Em                         F
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door
C    Em                            F
What is it that you're tryin' to achieve girl
C      Em                      F
Do you think we can talk about some more
              Dm
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
       Dm
Who've lost all ray of hope
G
You know, it's not even safe no more
       G
In the palace of the Pope

C           Em           F
Don't fall apart on me tonight
C            Em               F
I just don't think that I can handle it
C           Em           F
Don't fall apart on me tonight
Dm                 Em
Yesterday's just a memory, 
  F                           G
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be
      G
And I need you, yeah

Come over here from over there, girl
Sit down here, you can have my chair
I can't see us goin' anywhere, girl
The only place open is a 1000 miles away and I can't take you there

I wish that I'd been a doctor, 
Maybe I'd've saved some life that'd been lost
Maybe I'd've done some good in the world
'stead of burnin' every bridge I crossed

Don't fall apart on me tonight
I just don't think that I can handle it
Don't fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday's just a memory, 
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be
And I need you, yeah

I ain't too good at conversation, girl
So you might not know exactly how I feel
But if I could I'd bring you to the mountain top, girl
And build you a house made out of stainless steel
But it's like I'm stuck inside this painting
That's a-hangin' in the Louvre
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches
But I know that I can't move

Don't fall apart on me tonight
I just don't think that I can handle it
Don't fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday's gone, but the past live on
Tomorrow's just one step beyond
And I need you, yeah

F                             C
Who are these people that are walkin' towards you
       F                            C
Do you know them or will there be a fight? 
           F                   C
With their humorless smiles so easy to see through
         F                                 C
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right
   F               C
Or do you remember St. James St.
F                          C
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind
          F                           C
He was so fine Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
    F                    G
And laid his life on the line

Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl
No more booby traps and bombs, no more decadence and charms
No more affection that's misplaced, girl
No more mud caked creatures lyin' in your arms

What about that millionaire
With the drumsticks in his pants
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
When he played and we didn't dance

Don't fall apart on me tonight
I just don't think that I can handle it
Don't fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday's just a memory, 
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be
And I need you, yeah you, Ah, I need you
