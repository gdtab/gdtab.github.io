I Truly Understand
Traditional

I wish to the Lord I'd never been born,
Or died when I was young,
Before I'd seen your two brown eyes,
Or heard your lying tongue, love, or heard your lying tongue.

Chorus:
I truly understand you love another man,
And your heart shall no longer be mine.

I'll never listen to what another woman says,
Whether her hair be either black or brown,
I'd rather be on the top of some hill,
The rain a-pourin' down, love, the rain a-pourin' down.

Now who's gonna shoe your pretty little foot,
And who's gonna glove your hand?
Who's gonna be your own true love,
When I'm in a foreign land, love, when I'm in a foreign land.

Now mama's gonna shoe your pretty little foot,
And papa's gonna glove your hand,
And I'll still be your own true love,
When I'm in a foreign land, love, when I'm in a foreign land.
