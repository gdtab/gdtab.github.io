J & J McReynolds
Intro: 
D A E A A7

Chorus:
D            A
Hard hearted heart breaker
E              A
Dream stealer, love maker
D            A
Hard hearted heart breaker
E                                 A     A7
How many hearts have you broken today

E                        A
How many hearts have you broken today
E                       A
How many lives have you caused to go wrong
E                         A
How many hearts have been broken in two
B                                    E      E7
Just because your heart has proved untrue

How many lies have you told other guys
Just like the ones you told to me
Honey, someday you'll learn that the tide'll have to turn
Just keep on breaking hearts and you will see
