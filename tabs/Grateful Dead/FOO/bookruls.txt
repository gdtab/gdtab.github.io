F#                   B              F#
Isn't it strange how princesses and kings
    F#                 B          F#  
Can clown their capers in sawdust rings, just like
C#               
Poor people like you and me
        B             F#
Will be builders for eternity
B               C#
Each is given a bag of tools
B              B7     F#
Shapeless lives and a book of rules

Each must make his life as flowing ink
Tumbling back on a stepping stone, just like
Poor people like you and me
Will be builders for eternity
Each is given a bag of tools
Shapeless lives and a book of rules

F#              B                F#
Pow pa pow pow, pow wa pa pa pow pow
             C#                F#
wa pa pa pow pow wa pow pa pow pow pow

And I say small people like you and me
Will be builders for eternity
Each is given a bag of tools
Shapeless lives and a book of rules

Look where the rain is fallen from the sky
I know the sun will be only missing for awhile
And I say small people like you and me
Will be builders for eternity
Each is given a bag of tools
Shapeless lives and a book of rules

Pow pa pow pow, pow wa pa pa pow pow
wa pa pa pow pow wa pow pa pow pow pow

And I say small people like you and me
Will be builders for eternity
Each is given a bag of tools
Shapeless lives and a book of rules
