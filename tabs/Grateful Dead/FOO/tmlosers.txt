Too Many Losers
artist?
Lyrics Only

Well I used to know just what to think about that girl,
With that "can't help it" look in her eyes
Don't you go for it boy, it's a hook, You'd be mighty unwise
So I'm trying to tell just what the Hell I'm doing here,
You must have me hypnotized
Yes I must confess girl, you've taken me by complete surprise

Yeah here you come all wrapped in Heaven girl,
There you want to go powder your nose
Yeah that kind of stuff just makes your head rattle,
Putting your heart on hold
Still lost ain't the word for the way that I feel,
When I gaze into those baby grays
But you'll be gone come maniana morning,
be just another gray new day

I don't wanna play

Too many losers.  Too many losers.  Too many losers
You're making me crazy, you're stoking the fire

Yeah here we are up until dawn again babe,
Hard at work on making rules
Yeah leading each other on babe, It's a common pursuit of fools
Hey your good at this game, very very cool,
But don't play me like you other fools
I've got one distinct advantage, I don't observe no rules

Chorus - 6x
