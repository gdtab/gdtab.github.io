Traditional 
Arr. J. Garcia & D. Grisman

D
Three men went a-hunting
    G                  D
And something they did find
     D
They came upon a porcupine
    E              A
And that they left behind
    D
The Irishman said it's a porcupine
        G                D
And the Scotsman he said nay
    D
The Welshman said it's a pin cushion
         A                       D
With the pins stuck in the wrong way.

Three men went a-hunting
And something they did find
They came upon a toad frog
And that they left behind
The Irishman said it's a toad frog
And the Scotsman said may
The Welshman said it's a Jay bird
With the feathers worn away.

Three men went a-hunting
And something they did find
They came upon an outhouse
And that they left behind
The Irishman said it's an outhouse
The Scotsman he said nay
The Welshman said its a church house
With the steeple blown away.

Three men went a-hunting
And something they did find
They came upon Norton
And that they left behind
The Irishmam said it was Norton
The Scotsman he said nay
The Welshman said it's the end of the world
Let's go back the other way.
