The river so white 
F   Em          Dm     G
The mountain so red
C            G                F    Em   Dm  
And with the sunshine over my head
G                   F  C  Gm6      F       Em
The honky-tonks are all closed and hushed
   Dm              F      C      G    F    C
It looks like Palm Sunday again
Dm              F      C      G    F    C
It looks like Palm Sunday again
Dm              F      C      G    F    C
It looks like Palm Sunday again
