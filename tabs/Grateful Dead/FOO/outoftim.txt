Out Of Time
Jagger/Richards
G       
You don't know what's goin' on,
D
You've been away for far too long,
C                                      G
You can't come back and think you are still mine.
                        C
You're out of touch my baby,
    D              G
My poor discarded baby,
        C            D                 G
I said baby, baby, baby you're out of time.

G                               D
Baby, baby, baby you're out of time.
        Em                            C
I said baby, baby, baby you're out of time.
              G   C G   C              
You are left out,       out of there without a doubt.
        G           D                  G
I said baby, baby, baby you're out of time.

The girl who wants to run away,
Discovers that she's had her day,
It's no good, your thinkin' that you are still mine.
You're out of touch my baby,
My poor unfaithful baby,
I said baby, baby, baby you're out of time.

You thought you were a clever girl,
Givin' up your social world,
You can't come back and think that you're first in line.
You're obsolete my baby,
My poor old fashioned baby,
I said baby, baby, baby you're out of time.
