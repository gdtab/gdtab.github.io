Saw a werewolf with a Chinese menu in his hand
Walking thru the streets of Soho in the rain
He was looking for the place called Lee Ho Fook's
Going to get himself a big dish of beef chow mein
Ah-oo, the werewolves of London

If you hear his howling around the kitchen door
You better not let him in
Little old lady got mutilated late last nite
Werewolves of London again
Ah-oo, werewolves of London

He's the hairy-handed gent who ran amok in Kent
Lately he's been overheard in Mayfair
You better stay away from him, he'll rip your lungs out Jim
I'd like to meet his tailor
Ah-oo, werewolves of London

Well, I saw Lon Cheney walking with the Queen
Doing the Werewolves of London
I saw Lon Cheney Jr. walking with the Queen
I saw a werewolf drinking a pina colada at Trader Vic's
And his hair was perfect
Ah-oo, the werewolves of London, draw blood

Alternate lyrics/Warren Zevon:

Live version changes:
Instead of "I'd like to meet his tailor",
           "He's looking for...James Taylor!"

Last verse:
I saw werewolf tryin' to buy a used car at Jay Lamar
It was a blood-red Coup de Ville
He said he was a-drivin' it to Mexico
Goin' down to Tijuana, gonna kill somebody in a film...

ad lib
