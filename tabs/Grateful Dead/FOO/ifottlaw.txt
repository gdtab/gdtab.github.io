I Fought the Law
Sonny Curtis
Lyrics Only

Breakin' rocks in the hot sun
I fought the law and the law won (twice)

I needed money 'cause I had none
I fought the law and the law won (twice)

Chorus
I left my baby and it feels so bad
Guess my race is run

She the best that I ever had
I fought the law and the law won (twice)

Chorus
