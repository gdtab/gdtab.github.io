When A Man Loves A Woman
Hunter / Garcia
Lyrics Only

When you cross the sea of emotion, in a boat with no passenger side,
Throwing all sense of precaution to the waves to be lapped with the tide,
With the west pouring sun in your eyes, like the note of a bell from the blue,
Granting keys to the moon and the sky, and it means less than nothing to you.

Chorus
When a man loves a woman, the way I love you,
Nothing else matters, the way that you do.

When you sweat from the face for a living, to retain some semblance of pride,
And the work of your hands is a highway, or a car in which you'll never ride.
When the management threatens a layoff, and the union is striking for rights,
And your benefit claim is rejected, though the pain keeps you up in the nights.

Chorus

When you fail to live up to your promise, and you falter so far from your dreams,
And you have no distinction or honor, and your best coat is frayed at the seams.
As long as your lovelight is burning, the house can collapse to the ground.
As long as the world is turning, as long as she is still around.

Chorus

When a man writes a love song, and I don't mean a construct of rhyme,
But a couple of lines where his heart talks, seeming perfectly clear at the time.

Offers it up for your favor, instead of a diamond bouquet.
Don't ask what he means by forever, accept that he means it today.

Chorus
