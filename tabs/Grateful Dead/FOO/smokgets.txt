Smoke Gets In Your Eyes
Otto Harbach/Jerome Kern

They asked me how I knew 
my true love was true?
I of course replied, 
"Something here inside, 
cannot be denied."

They said someday you'll find, 
all who love are blind.
When your heart's on fire,
you must realize, 
Smoke Gets In Your Eyes.

So I chaffed them and I gayly laughed, 
to think they could doubt my love,
Yet today, my love has flown away, 
I am without my love.

Now laughing friends deride, 
tears I can not hide,
so I smile and say, 
"When a lovely flame dies, 
Smoke Gets In Your Eyes."
