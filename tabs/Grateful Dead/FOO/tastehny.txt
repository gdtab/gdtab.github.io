A Taste Of Honey
As Recorded By The Beatles
F#m               A            E            F#m
A taste of honey, tasting much sweeter than wine

  F#m      F#m-       F#m7     B
I dream of your first kiss and then,
  F#m   F#m-   F#m7   B
I feel upon my lips again,
            F#m   A            E            F#m
A taste of honey, tasting much sweeter than wine

   A    B         A     B
I will return, I will return
          A             E         F#m
I'll come back for the honey, and you

Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart
There lingers still, though we're far apart,
The taste of honey, tasting much sweeter than wine
