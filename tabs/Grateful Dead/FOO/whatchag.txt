Whatcha Gonna Do
Bob Dylan
Lyrics Only

Tell Me what you're gonna do
When the shadow comes under your door.
Tell me what you're gonna do
When the shadow comes under your door.
Tell me what you're gonna do
When the shadow comes under your door.
Oh Lord, Oh Lord,
What shall you do ?

Tell me what you're gonna do
When the Devil calls your cards.
Tell me what you're gonna do
When the Devil calls your cards.
Tell me what you're gonna do
When the Devil calls your cards.
Oh Lord, Oh Lord,
What shall you do ?

Tell me what you're gonna do
When the water turns to wine.
Tell me what you're gonna do
When the water turns to wine.
Tell me what you're gonna do
When the water turns to wine.
Oh Lord, Oh Lord,
What should you do ?

Tell me what you're gonna do
When you can't play God no more.
Tell me what you're gonna do
When you can't play God no more.
Tell me what you're gonna do
When you can't play God no more.
Oh Lord, Oh Lord,
What shall you do ?

Tell me what you're gonna do
When the shadow comes creepin' in your room.
Tell me what you're gonna do
When the shadow comes creepin' in your room.
Tell me what you're gonna do
When the shadow comes creepin' in your room.
Oh Lord, Oh Lord,
What should you do ?
