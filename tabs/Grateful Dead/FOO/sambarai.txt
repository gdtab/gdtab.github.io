Samba in the Rain
Welnick / Hunter
Lyrics Only

Ten and ten is thirty
if you tell me it is so
Let's get down and dirty, baby
Let's get sweet and low

Any way you call the shot
That's how it's gonna be
You can serve it cold or hot
It's all okay by me

Tie me up with ribbon bow
Wrap me in cellophane
Send me out to steal the show
or Samba in the rain

Samba in the rain oh baby
Samba in the rain
Let's get down and dirty
Don't bother to explain

Don't care if they call a cop
and say we are insane
we'll keep goin' til we drop
Samba in the rain

How many hours in a day
They tell me twenty four
There could be a couple less
I know it aint no more

We can do the dirty bop
The Darktown Strutter's Ball
Just as long as we don't stop
We'll dance right up the wall

We can do the bump and grind
The Apache in Spain
We can do the never mind
or Samba in the rain
