What a wonderful world this would be [ Em C G ]
What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world. [ Em C D G ]

Don't know much about history [ G Em ]
Don't know much biology [ Am D ]
Don't know much about a science book [ G Em ]
Don't know much about the French I took [ Am D ]
But I do know that I love you [ G C ]
And I know that if you love me, too [ G C ]
What a wonderful world this would be [ Em C G ]

Don't know much about geography [ G Em ]
Don't know much trigonometry [ Am D ]
Don't know much about algebra [ G Em ]

But I do know one and one is two [ G C ]
And if this one could be with you [ G C ]
What a wonderful world this would be [ Em C G ]
What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, world [ Em C G ]

Now I don't claim to be an "A" student [ D G ]
But I'm trying to be [ D G ]
'Cause maybe by being an "A" student, baby, baby [ Em A ]
I could win your love for me [ Am7 D ]

Don't know much about the middle ages [ G Em ]
Look at the pictures and I turn the pages [ Am D ]
Don't know nothing 'bout no rise and fall [ G Em ]
Don't know nothin' 'bout nothing at all [ Am D ]
Girl it's you that I've been thinking of [ G C ]
And if I could only win your love [ G C ]
What a wonderful world this would be [ Em C G ]
What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world [ Em C G ]
What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world [ Em C G ]
