Sing Me Back Home
Merle Haggard

    A              E                 D              A
The warden led the prisoner down the hallway to his doom
        A             Asus4    A       E      B   E
I stood up to say goodbye like all the rest
      A                  E             D                     A
And I heard him tell the warden just before they reached my cell
       A              E                 A      D    A
Let my guitar playin' friend sing my request

A            E      D              A
Sing me back home a song I used to hear. 
A    Asus4  A             E      B  E
Make my old memories come alive.
A        E       D             A
Sing me away and turn back the year. 
A    Asus4   A       E     A      D   A   
Sing me back home before I die.

I recall last Sunday morning when the choir from off the street
Came in to sing a few old gospel songs
And I heard him tell the singers there's a song my mother sang
Can I hear it before you travel on.

Sing me back home a song I used to hear. 
Make my old memories come alive.
Sing me away and turn back the year. 
Sing me back home before I die.
