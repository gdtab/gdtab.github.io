G                             C   G
Once upon a time there was an engineer
G                       A       D
Drove a locomotive both far and near
  G                               C
Accompanied by a monkey who would sit on a stool
G             A             D          G
Watchin' everything the engineer would do

One day the engineer wanted a bite to eat
Left the monkey sittin' on the driver's seat
The monkey pulled the draw, the locomotive jumped the gun
And did ninety miles an hour down the main line run

G               C        G
Big locomotive, right on time
G                      A        D
Big locomotive, comin' down the line
G                      C
Big locomotive, number ninety-nine
G            A           D       G
Left the engineer with a worried mind

The engineer called up the dispatcher on the phone
Tell him all about his locomotive was gone
Been on the wire, switch operator to write
'Cause the monkey's got the main line sown up tight

Switch operator got the message in time
Said, "There's a north bound livin' on the same main line
Open up the switch, I'm gonna let him through the whole
'Cause the monkey's got the locomotive under control!"
