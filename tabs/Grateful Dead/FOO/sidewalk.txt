Sidewalks of New York
James W. Blake and Charles E. Lawlor

Down in front of Casey's old brown wooden stoop,
On a summer's evening we formed a merry group;
Boys and girls together we would sing and waltz
While Tony played the organ on the sidewalks of New York.

Chorus: 
East side, west side, all around the town,
The tots sang "ring-a-rosie," "London Bridge is falling down."
Boys and girls together, me and Mamie O'Rourke
Tripped the light fantastic
On the sidewalks of New York.

That's where Johnny Casey, little Jimmy Crowe
Jakey Krause, the baker, who always had the dough,
Pretty Nellie Shannon with a dude as light as cork
She first picked up the waltz step on the sidewalks of New York.

Things have changed since those times, some are up in "G"
Others they are wand'rers but they all feel just like me
They'd part with all they've got, could they once more walk
With their best girl and have a twirl on the sidewalks of New York.
