Oh, The Wind And The Rain

There were two sisters came walking down the stream
D       A            E
Oh, the wind and the rain
E                     A
One behind pushed the other one in
       B       C#m      D        E
Cryin' oh, the dreadful wind and rain

Johnny gave the youngest a gay gold ring
Oh, the wind and the rain
Didn't give the oldest one anything
Cryin' oh, the dreadful wind and rain

Pushed her into the river to drown
Oh, the wind and the rain
And watched her as she floated down
Cryin' oh, the dreadful wind and rain

She floated 'till she came to a fisher in the pond
Oh, the wind and the rain
Cryin' father, oh father there swims a swan
Cryin' oh, the dreadful wind and rain

Miller pulled her out with his drifting hook
Oh, the wind and the rain
And pulled that fair maid from the brook
Cryin' oh, the dreadful wind and rain

Left her on the bank to dry
Cryin' Oh, the wind and the rain
And a fiddling fool come passing by
Cryin' oh, the dreadful wind and rain

Out of the woods came a fiddler fair
Oh, the wind and the rain
He took thirty strands of her long yellow hair
Cryin' oh, the dreadful wind and rain

And he made a fiddle bow of her long yellow hair
Oh, the wind and the rain
And he made a fiddle bow of her long yellow hair
Cryin' oh, the dreadful wind and rain

He made fiddle pegs of her long finger bones
Oh, the wind and the rain
He made fiddle pegs of her long finger bones
Cryin' oh, the dreadful wind and rain

And he made a little fiddle of her breast bone
Oh, the wind and the rain
Whose sound could melt a heart of stone
Cryin' oh, the dreadful wind and rain

And the only tune that fiddle would play was
Oh, the wind and the rain
The only tune that fiddle would play was
Oh, the dreadful wind and rain
