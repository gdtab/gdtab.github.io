But roll, roll around heaven all day

Fuss with my woman toil for my kids

Show me that river, take me across  
And wash all my troubles away.

Like That Lucky Old Sun, give me nothin' to do 
But roll, roll around heaven all day

Show me that river
Lead me across and wash all my troubles away.

Like That Luck-y Old Sun, give me nothin' to do 
But roll, roll around heaven
Roll, roll around heaven
I want to roll around heaven all day
