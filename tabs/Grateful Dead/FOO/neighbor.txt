Neighbor, Neighbor
?artist?

Neighbor, neighbor don't you worry what goes on in my home
You're always lookin' for something to gossip about
Running around door to door 
Runnin' your mouth about things you don't know
Neighbor, neighbor don't you worry what goes on in my home

Neighbor, neighbor don't you worry how I treat my wife
You tell everybody we fuss and fight every night
Bad news travels and I travel too
Something bad's gonna happen to you
Neighbor, neighbor don't you worry what goes on in my home

Neighbor, neighbor don't you worry what goes on in my home
You're always lookin' for something to gossip about
Running around door to door 
Runnin' your mouth about things you don't know
Neighbor, neighbor don't you worry what goes on in my home

Neighbor, neighbor don't you worry how I treat my wife
You tell everybody we fuss and fight every night
Bad news travels and I travel too
Something bad's gonna happen to you
Neighbor, neighbor don't you worry what goes on in my home

Neighbor, neighbor don't worry who knocks on my door
You're always face ....in the hall

Neighbor, neighbor don't you worry what goes on in my home
Neighbor, neighbor don't you worry what goes on in my home
