Tight Connection To My Heart 
(Has Anybody Seen My Love)
Bob Dylan
             A                      D
You've got a tight connection to my heart
             A                      D
You've got a tight connection to my heart

        A
Well, I had to move fast
      C#m
And I couldn't with you around my neck
  F#m
I said I'd send for you and I did
     D
Now, what did you expect?
   A                         C#m                  D
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet

         A
I'll go along with the charade
            C#m
Until I can think my way out
  F#m             
I know it was all a big joke
         D
Whatever it was about
A                    C#m         D
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget
    Bm
I'm gonna get my coat
   Bm
I feel the breath of storm
        E
There's something I've got to do tonight
E
You go inside and stay warm

    A               D
Has anybody seen my love?
    A               D
Has anybody seen my love?
    A               D
Has anybody seen my love?
Bm
I don't know
    E               A
Has anybody seen my love?

You want to talk to me
Go ahead and talk
Nothing you could say
Would come as any kind of shock
I must be guilty of something, just whisper it into my ear

Madame Butterfly, 
She lulled me to sleep
In a town without pity
Where the waters run deep
She said, "Be easy baby,
There ain't nothin' worth stealin' in here"

You're the one for me baby, the one who's got the key
But I can't figure out whether 
	I'm too good for you, or your too good for me

Well, there ain't no stars tonight
Not even the moon
Just a hot-blooded singer 
Singin' Memphis in June
And they're beatin' the hell out of a guy
'Cause he's wearin' a powder blue wig

Later he'll be shot 
For resisting arrest
I can still hear him cryin'
In the wilderness
What looks large from a distance
Up close ain't nearly so big

I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine
I never could learn to hold you love and call you mine

You've got a tight connection to my heart
You've got a tight connection to my heart
