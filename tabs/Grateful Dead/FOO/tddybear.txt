Today's the day the teddy bears have their picnic.

Every teddy bear whose been good
Is sure of a treat today
There's lots of marvelous things to eat
And wonderful games to play
Beneath the trees where nobody sees
They'll hide and seek as long as they please
'Cause that's the way the teddy bears have their picnic.

Ab
Picnic time for teddy bears, the little teddy bears
                    Eb7
Are having a lovely time today watch them, catch them unawares
                                  Ab
And see them picnic on their holiday
Ab
See them gaily gad about, they love, to play and shout
                    Db7
They never have any cares
   Db 9 11 11 10 9 9     Dbmin7 9 11 9 10 9 10
At six o'clock their mommies, and
             Ab   G    Gb      F
Daddies will take them home to bed
                 Bb           Eb7   Ab      E7
Because they're, tired little teddy bears.

If you go down in the woods today
You better not go alone
It's lovely down in the woods today
But safer to stay at home
For every bear that ever there was
Will gather there together because
Today's the day the teddy bears have their picnic.  {x2}

The Grateful Dead's Concert
Carl Burger
Sung to the tune of "Teddy Bear's Picnic"

If you go out in the woods today you're in for a big surprise,
If you go out in the woods today you wouldn't believe your eyes
'Cause every freak that ever there was*
Is freaking there this morning because
Today's the day The Grateful Dead give their concert.

If you go out in the woods today be ready to hide your food,
If you go out in the woods today be ready for talk that's crude,
Though some of them are wonderful folk
You can't see them because of the smoke
Today's the day The Grateful Dead give their concert.

Concert time for The Grateful Dead
The Grateful Dead, he said,
They're gonna be cranking up today!
See the deadheads still in bead
We need the campsites, it's a holiday
Try to roust them, go ahead!
Try to collect from them, they'll say that they have no bread
But at six o'clock you'll find them at Stanford standing in a line
To give their bread to The Grateful Dead

If you go out in the woods today you probably won't see deer,
It's not a park, it's a parking lot
With copious cans of beer.
But still we'll try as best we can
To start a dead VW van
Today's the day The Grateful Dead give their concert.

*or "'Cause every head that ever was was/is heading there
this morning because "
