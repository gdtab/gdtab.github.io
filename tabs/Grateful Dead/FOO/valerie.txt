Hey Valerie, Baby what's the matter with you?
A                                          E
I did all of the things that you wanted me to

Bm                      A      E
I went downtown with my pocket knife, 
Bm                        A          E
Cut your other man, but I spared his life
Bm            A              E
Valerie won't you be good to me?

Hey Valerie, Baby what's the matter with you?
Come on, come Baby, and tell me true
Hey now Baby, what did I do? 
I shot my dog 'cause he growled at you
Valerie won't you be good to me?

B                              E
Valerie what's the matter with me? 
  A                      E
I never ever done you no wrong
B                       E         A
I sing the blues nearly all night long.
B                            E
Valerie what the matter with me? 
             A                      E
You know I'd do anything that you'd say
Bm                         A                   E
I can't understand why you tell me "Please go 'way"

I ain't afraid of the cold, cruel world outside
No chicken little running from a falling sky
The only thing trouble's me is you. 
If you leave me what will I do?
Valerie won't you be good to me?

You got me down on the knees of my shaking feet
Can't play the blues 'cause for you I drop the beat
Valerie what your complaint? 
I try to be everything I ain't
Valerie won't you be good to me?
