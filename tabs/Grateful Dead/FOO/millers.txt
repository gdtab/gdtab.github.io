The Miller's Will
Traditional
Arr. J. Garcia & D. Grisman
      D
There was an old miller and he lived alone
A                  D
Had three sons all fully grown
G                     D
When the time came to make out his will
D                     A            D
All he had left was a little grist mill.

          D                        A         D
Refrain:	Singin' fol-dig-a-di-oh, Fol dig-a-day.

He called to him his eldest son
Said, "son, oh son my race is run
If I a miller of you make
Pray tell me what toll you take?"

Father, oh father my name is Bill
Out of each bushel I'd take a gill
You fool you fool the old man cries
On such a little you'll never get a rise.

He called to him his, second son 
Said, "son oh son my race is run 
If I a miller of you make 
Pray tell me what toll you'd take?"

Father, oh father my name is, Ralph
Out of each bushel I'd take half
Not enough, not enough the old man said
Such a little you'd never get ahead.

He called to him his youngest son
Said, "son oh son my race is run
If I a miller of you make
Pray tell me what toll you would take?"

Father, oh father my name is Paul
Out of each bushel I'd take all
Hallelujah, the old man cried
Then he turned up him toes, and he died.

They buried him in a little box grave
Some do not think his soul was saved
Where he went I could not say
But I rather believe he went the other way.

Other lyrics
There was an old miller by everyone known
He had three sons was all nigh grown
When he came to die and make his will
He had nothing to give but an old tub* mill

He called up his eldest son
He says, "My son, I'm almost done
And if the mill to you I'd make
Pray tell me how much toll you intend to take?"

"Oh dear father, my name is Heck
And out of each bushel I'll take one peck
And every bushel I do grind
A very fine living at that I'll find"

"You are a fool," the old man said,
"You have not fairly learned my trade
The mill to you I will not give
For never a miller at that can live"

He next called up his second son
He says, "My son, I'm almost done
And if the mill to you I'd make
Pray tell me how much toll you intend to take?"

"Oh dear father, my name is Ralph
And out of each bushel I'd take one half
And every bushel I do grind
A very fine living at that I'll find"

"You are a fool," the old man said,
"You have not fairly learned my trade
The mill to you I will not give
For never a miller at that can live"

He next called up his youngest son
He says, "My son, I'm almost done
And if the mill to you I'd make
Pray tell me how much toll you intend to take?"

"Oh dear father, I am your son
I'll take three pecks and leave just one
And if a good living at that I do lack
I'll take the other and swear to the sack"

"You are my son," the old man said,
"For you have fairly learned my trade
The mill is yours," the old man cried,
And he closed up his eyes and died

note: "tub" mill must be grist mill

There was an old miller who lived all alone
He had three sons who were almost grown
When he came to die and to make his will
He had nothing to give but a little old mill

Sing fal-a dick-a di-do, fal dick-a day

First called his eldest son
"Son, oh, Son, my race is run
If the mill by will to you I make
I want you to tell me the toll you'd take?"

"Father, dear Father, my name is Beck
Out of each bushel I'll take a peck."
"Fool, oh Fool," the old man cried
On the take of such toll no man can ride."

Then he called his second son
"Son, oh, Son, My race is run
If the mill by will to you I make
I want you to tell me the toll you'd take?"

"Father, dear Father, my name is Ralph
Out of each bushel I'll take a half
"Fool, oh Fool," the old man cried
On the take of such toll no man can ride."

Then he called his youngest son
"Son, oh, Son, My race is run
If the mill by will to you I make
I want you to tell me the toll you'd take?"

"Father, dear Father, my name is Jack
I'll steal all the corn and swear to the sack
"The mill is yours," the old man cried,
And then he closed up his eyes and died
