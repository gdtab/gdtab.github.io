From Me To You
Lennon/McCartney
      C                Am
Da da da da da dum dum da  (2x)

            C                Am
If there's anything that you want
            C             G7
If there's anything I can do,
     F7                  Am                  C
Just call on me and I'll send it along with love
     G7    C
From me to you.

I've got everything that you want,
Like a heart that's oh, so true
Just call on me and I'll send it along,
With love from me to you.

Gm7                     C7            F        C7    F
I got arms that long to hold you, and keep you by my side
      Am7               D7             G7         G7+5
I got lips that long to kiss you, and keep you satisfied, ooh

If there's anything that you want
If there's anything I can do,
Just call on me and I'll send it along with love
From me to you.

Am
To you
G#7
To you
       C               Am
Da da da da da dum dum da
