Could have been a spoonful of coffee
Could have been a spoonful of tea
Just a little spoon of your precious love is good enough for me
Man lies about that, man cries about that
Man dies about that, spoonful, spoonful, spoonful

Could have been a spoonful of water
Spread out on the desert sand
Just a little spoon fortifies, save you from another man
Man lies about that, man cries about that
Even dies about that, spoonful, spoonful, spoonful

Could have been a spoonful of diamonds
Could have been a spoonful of gold
Just a little spoon of your precious love to satisfy my soul

Everybody's talking about spoonful
Spoonful, spoonful, spoonful
Everybody's fighting about spoonful
