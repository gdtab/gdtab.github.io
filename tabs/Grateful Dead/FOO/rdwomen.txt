Rainy Day Women #12 & 35
Bob Dylan

              F(D)                  Do7(Bo7)  C7(A7) F(D)
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so  good
              F(D)      Do7(Bo7) C7(A7)    F(D)
They'll stone you just like they said they would
F7(D7)  Bb7(G7)               Go7(Eo7)   Bb7(G7)
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home
              F(D)    Do7(Bo7)       C7(A7) F(D)
And they'll stone you when you're there all alone
      C7(A7)
But I would not feel so all alone
F(D)      Do7(Bo7) C7(A7) F(D)
Everybody must     get    stoned

Well, they'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table
They'll stone you when you are young and able
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car
And they'll stone you when you're playing your guitar
But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street
They'll stone you when you're tryin' to keep your seat
They'll stone you when you're tryin' to make a buck
Then they'll stone you and then they'll say "good luck"
But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

instrumental verse:
|C         B  Bb | A         A  Bb  B | C         B  Bb | A       D  Eb  E |
|F         E  Eb | D         A  Bb  B | C         B  Bb | A                |
|CCC C C C C C C | CCC C C C C A Bb B | C         B  Bb | A                |

Well, they'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table
They'll stone you when you are young and able
They'll stone you and they'll say that you are brave
They'll stone you when you're sent down in your grave
But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned
Notes:
Original key is F. I've like to sing it in the key of D though
which accounts for the chords in parenthesis. Plus it makes the diminished
chords a little easier to play!

Chords: Do7  : XX3434
        Go7  : 3X232X
