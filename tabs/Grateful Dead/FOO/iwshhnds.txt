I Wash My Hands
J. Babcock
Lyrics Only

I wash my hands in the muddy water
I wash my hands but they wouldn't come clean
I wash my hands in the muddy water
But I must have washed my hands in a muddy stream

Well I was born in ol' Virginia
North Carolina, I did wrong
If I'd listen to what daddy told me
I would not be so rude and all alone
