        E                         A    C
There's mosquitoes on the river 
         E                      A    C
Fish are rising up like birds
          E 
It's been hot for seven weeks now,
A               C
Too hot to even speak now, 
        E
Did you hear what I just heard?

Say it might have been a fiddle 
Or it could have been the wind
But there seems to be a beat now 
I can feel it my feet now
Listen here it comes again!

Sun went down in honey 
        A                      D  F  G
And the moon came up in wine,
         A
You know stars were spinnin' dizzy, 
         D                F 
Lord the band kept us so busy 
G     D    E        A             E   F#   B
We forgot about the time.

They're a band beyond description, 
Like Jehovah's favorite choir
People joining hand in hand 
While the music played the band, 
Lord, they're setting us on fire.

Crazy rooster crowin' midnight, 
Balls of lightin' roll along
Old men sing about their dreams, 
Women laugh and children scream
And the band keeps playin' on.

Keep on dancin' thru the daylight, 
               (Keep on dancin' thru the daylight)
Greet the mornin' air with song
                     (Greet the mornin' air with song)
No ones's noticed, but the band's all pack and gone.
                                             (packed & gone) 
Was it ever there at all?
           (we're they ever here at all)
But they keep on dancin' 
C'mon children, C'mon children, Come on clap your hands

Well the cool breeze came on Tuesday, 
And the corn's a bumper crop
And the fields are full of dancin' 
Full of singin' and romancin'
The music never stopped.
