Lay down my dear brother, lay down and take your rest,
Won't you lay your head upon your savior's breast?
I love you all but Jesus loves you the best
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight.
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight.

Walking in Jerusalem just like John (goodnight, goodnight)
I would never ride, well, I would never ride  (goodnight, goodnight)
But His rod and His staff, they comfort me (goodnight, goodnight)
Tell "A" for the ark, that wonderful boat (goodnight, goodnight)
Tell "B" for the beast at the ending of the wood (goodnight,goodnight)
You know it ate all the children when they wouldn't be good,
Walking in Jerusalem just like John (goodnight, goodnight)
I go walking in the valley of the shadow of death,
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight.

Lay down my dear brother, lay down and take your rest,
Won't you lay your head upon your savior's breast?
I love you all but Jesus loves you the best.
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight.
And we bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight.
