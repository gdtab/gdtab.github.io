The Race Is On
Don Rollins
G
I feel tears welling up from down deep inside,
C                         G
Like my heart's got a big break.
      A                                         D
And a stab of loneliness sharp and painful that I may never shake.

C
You might think that I'm taking it hard
  C                           G
Since you broke me off with a call,
    G
You might wager that I'll hide in sorrow
 D                             G
And I might lay right down and bawl.

Chorus
Now the race is on and here comes pride up the back stretch,
Heartache's a goin' to the inside,
My tears are holding back, tryin' not to fall.
My heart's out of the running,
True love scratched for another's sake,
The race is on and it looks like heartaches,
And the winner loses all.

Jam

One day I ventured in love never once suspecting
What the final result would be.
Now I live in fear of waking up each morning,
And finding that you're gone from me.
There's an aching pain in my heart
For the name of the one that I hated to face,
Someone else came out to win her, and I came out in second place.

Chorus - Jam - Chorus
  G
And the race is on and looks like heartaches,
D              G     C    D G
And the winner loses all.
