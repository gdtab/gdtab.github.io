Baba O'Reilly
The Who

Starts out on a synth, but using two guitars:
Guitar 1: 	Finger  	Guitar 2:	Finger
		e  x				e 13
		B  x				B 13
		G 10 				G 10
		D 10				D  x
		A  8				A  x
		E  x				E  x

Guitar 1 pick quickly A-A-D-D-G-G-D-D-A-A-D-D-G-G-D-D
	(all sixteenth notes) over and over (this is until
	the end of the song, when the violin comes in.)

Guitar 2 pick quickly G-G-B-B-e (The G and B strings are
	played as sixteenth, the e is picked as an eighth)

After 5 repetitions, the piano enters, after four piano and synth parts,
	the drums and bass enter.  The piano and bass play a simple
	F-C-Bb progression

For guitar in place of piano, it is played

     F                                             C     Bb
e    5                                             3      1
B    6                                             5      3
G    5                                             5      3
D    x                                             x      x
A    x                                             x      x
E    x                                             x      x

The first verse is played the same way:

F               C     Bb
Out here in the fields
I fight for my meals
I get my back into my living
I don't need to fight
To prove I'm right
I don't need to be forgiven
(yeah yeah yeah yeah ye-ah!)

NOW Townshend throws in the power chords along the same rhythm (F-C-Bb)
Play that pattern 5 times, then it softens for the bridge:
Play C5 three times, then softly strum a first-position C chord
(With the opening F5 synth pattern only:)

C5 C5 C5 C

Don't cry
Don't raise your eyes
It's only a teenage wasteland

The chords ring in again, with bass and drums, the synth still rolling

Sally take my hand
We'll travel south cross land
Put out the fire but don't look past my shoulder
The exodus is here
The happy won't come near
Let's get together before we get much older

A soft guitar solo, in the same key, but one I can't figure out yet.

Hitting a few F5 chords, the drums and bass ring back
	in and the bar chords return in the F-C-Bb pattern:

Teenage wasteland!
Teenage wasteland!
Teenage wasteland, oh yeah!
Teenage wasteland!
They're all wasted!

F  F  C  C  Bb Bb C  C

F chord:
e: -12-13-15--12-13-15-1213-15
Repeat, over a C then Bb chord, then, over C
e: -15-13-15-13-15-12--15-13-15-12-13-15-12-----15

The violin comes in over the synth part, which fades
	out as the violin plays until the end, when
	the synth returns for a crescendo up onto yet
	again the F5 chord.
