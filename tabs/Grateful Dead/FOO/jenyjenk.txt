D
Will you wear white
      A
Oh my dear, oh my dear
D                          A
Will you wear white, Jenny Jenkins?
     D
No I won't wear white
        G
For the color's too bright.

Refrain:
     D
I'll buy me a foldy-roldy, tildy-toldy
D
Seek-a-double, use-a-cozza roll to find me
     A               D
Roll, Jenny Jenkins, roll.

Will you wear green...
No, I won't wear green
It's a shame to be seen.

Will you wear blue...
No, I won't wear blue
For the color's too true.

Will you wear yellow...
No, I won't wear yellow
For I'd never get a fellow,

Will you wear brown...
No, I won't wear brown
For I'd never get around.

Will you wear beige 
No, I won't wear beige 
For it shows my age.

Will you wear orange 
No, orange I won't wear 
And it rhymes so there.

What will you wear?
Oh what do you care, 
If I just go bare.
