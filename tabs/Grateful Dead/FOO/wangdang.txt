There is definitely only the one chord to this song.  It seems though, that every version I listen to is in a different key.  Flexible enough tune, I guess.  The riff, however, is presented for the key of B.  You may move it around as you see fit.

Tell Automatic Slim
Tell Razor Totin' Jim
Tell Butcher Knife Totin' Annie
Tell Fast Talkin' Fanny
Tonite we're gonna pitch a ball
Down to that union hall
Gonna romp and tromp 'till midnight
We're gonna fuss and fight 'till daylight
We're gonna pitch a wang dang doodle all night long

Tell Cedar-Crawling Red 
To tell Abyssinian Ed
Tell old Pistol Pete 
To tell every one he meet
Tonight we need no rest
We're really gonna throw a mess
We're gonna break out all the windows
Gonna kick down all the doors
We're gonna pitch a wang dang doodle all nite long

Tell Fats and Washboard Sam
That everybody's gonna jam
Tell Shakey and Boxcar 
We got sawdust on the floor
Tell Peg and Carol Dime
We gonna have a hell of a time
When the fish scent fills the air
There'll be snuff juice everywhere
We're gonna pitch a wang dang doodle all nite long
