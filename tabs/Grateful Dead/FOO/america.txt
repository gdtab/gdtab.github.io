America (My Country 'Tis of Thee)
Samuel F. Smith

My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty
Of thee, I sing
Land where my fathers dies, land of the Pilgrim's pride
From every mountain side, let freedom ring.

My native country, thee - Land of the noble free
Thy name I love
I love thy rocks and rills, thy woods and templed hills
My heart with rapture thrill, like that above.

Let music swell the breeze, and ring from all the trees
Sweet freedom's song
Let mortal tongues awake, let all that breathe partake
Let rocks their silence break, The sound prolong.

Our father's God to thee, author of liberty
To thee we sing
Long may our land be bright with freedom's holy light
Protect us by Thy might, great God, our king.
