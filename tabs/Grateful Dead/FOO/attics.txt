In the    attics of my life, 
A       E    B  A       E
Full of cloudy dreams unreal.
E    Esus4  E      B7  E     B7   E
Full of     tastes no tongue can know, 
A   E     B   A       E
And lights no eye can see.
E    G#    A      E  F#m7    E  A              E
When there was no ear     to hear, you sang to me.

Esus4   E

I have spent my life 
Seeking all that's still unsung.
Bent my ear to hear the tune, 
And closed my eyes to see.                       F#m7  F#
When there was no strings to play, you played to me.

B          A               D     A
In the book of love's own dream, 
E     E7sus4            E7  Asus4   A
Where all     the print is blood.
      Asus4  A  Asus4  A  Asus4  A   D
Where all   the pag    es are    my days, 
B       Bsus4  B7          E
And all my     lights grow old.
A             Asus4  A  D    A
When I had no wings to fly, 
E   Esus4         D
You       flew to me, 
B   B9  B7     A    E    E7sus4   D      A  E
You flew    to me.

In the secret space of dreams, 
Where I dreaming lay amazed.
When the secrets all are told, 
And the petals all unfold.
When there was no dream of mine, you dreamed of me.
