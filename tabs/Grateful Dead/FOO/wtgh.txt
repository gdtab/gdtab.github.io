Way To Go Home
Welnick / Hunter / Brad Bralove
Lyrics Only

 Who do you think you are?
what do you mean when you put us all down
walking round in circles
your nose to the ground
you think you're saying something

because you're making a sound
you say you've seen it all
you don't care to see no more
but you don't get up and go
until they throw you out the door

Chorus

it's a long long long long way to go home
it's a long long long long way to go home
any which way you are tempted to roam
it's a long long long long long long way
way to go home

who do remind me of
what do you do when you do your own time
did you run away from the scene of your crime
i feel as though i know you
could you spare me a dime

its a lot less than a prison
but it's more than a jail
i'd tell you all about it
but that's another tale

Chorus

you say you've seen it all
you don't care to see no more
the hungry and the hopeless
the crippled and the poor
you say you've seen enough
to last you all your days
but like the moon in heaven
your just going through a phase

who do you want to be?
what do you need
to set your body free
i don't mean to pry

This aint the third degree
but looking at you baby
you remind myself of me
if there's anyway to tell you
anyway to persuade

I'd really love to spare you
The mistakes I've made

Chorus
