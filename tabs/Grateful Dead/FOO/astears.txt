As Tears Go By
Jagger/Richards

G         A              C  D
It is the evening of the day
G         A                  C   D
I sit and watch the children play
C             D
Smiling faces I can see
G   G/F#    Em    G  D  C
But not for me
C                           D
I sit and watch as tears go by

My riches can't buy everything
I want to hear the children sing
All I hear is the sound
Of rain falling on the ground
I sit and watch as tears go by

It is the evening of the day
I sit and watch the children play
Doing things I used to do
They think of you
I sit and watch as tears go by
