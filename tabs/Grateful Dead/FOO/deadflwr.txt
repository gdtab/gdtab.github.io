Dead Flowers
Rolling Stones
      D                   A
Well, when you're sitting there
        G                D
In your silk upholstered chair
D               A                   G       D
Talkin' to some rich folks that you know
  D              A
I hope you don't see me
       G           D
And my ragged company
D                A         G       D
You know I could never be alone.

        A                           D
Take me down, little Susie, take me down
A                                             D      D7
I know you think you're the Queen of the Underground
        G                          D
You can send me dead flowers every morning
G                           D
Send me dead flowers by the mail
G                          D          Bm
Send me dead flowers to my wedding
      D                   A             G       D
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave.

Yeah, and when you're sitting back
In your rose pink Cadillac
Making bets on Kentucky Derby day
I'll be in my basement room
With a needle and a spoon
And another girl to take my pain away.
