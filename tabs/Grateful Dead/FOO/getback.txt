Get Back
Lennon / McCartney
Lyrics Only

JoJo was a man who thought he was a woman,
But he knew it couldn't last
JoJo left his home in Tucson, Arizona for some California grass.
Get back, get back, get back to where you once belonged
Get back JoJo, go home, get back, get back Joe

Sweet Loretta Modern thought she was a woman, but she was another man
All the other girls around here said she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can.

Oh, get back, get back, get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back, get back to where you once belonged

Get back Loretta, go home,
Get back to where you where you once belonged
Get back, your mommy's waiting for you
Wearing her high heeled shoes and her low neck sweater,
Get back home Loretta
