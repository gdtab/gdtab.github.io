Camptown Races
Stephen Foster

The Camptown ladies sing this song,
Doo-da, doo-da
The Camptown racetrack's two miles long
Oh, the doo-da day

Chorus:
Goin' to run all night
Goin' to run all day
I bet my money on a bob-tailed nag
Somebody bet on the gray.

Oh, de long tailed filly and de big black horse,
Doo-da, doo-da,
Come to a mud hole and they all cut across,
Oh, the doo-da day.

Chorus

I went down South with my hat caved in,
Doo-da, doo-da,I came back North with a pocket full of tin.
Oh, the doo-da day.
