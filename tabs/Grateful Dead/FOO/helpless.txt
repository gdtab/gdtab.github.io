C          G               F     
There is a town in north Ontario,
C          G                 F     
With dream comfort memory to spare,
C         G            F                  
And in my mind I still need a place to go,
C      G            F     
All my changes were there,

Blue, blue windows behind the stars,
Yellow moon on the rise,
Big birds flying across the sky,
Throwing shadows on our eyes. Leave us...

C         G             F   
Helpless, helpless, helpless
C    G               F   
Baby can you hear me now?
C              G                F              
The chains are locked and tied across the door,
C     G                F   
Baby, sing with me somehow.

Blue, blue windows behind the stars,
Yellow moon on the rise,
Big birds flying across the sky,
Throwing shadows on our eyes. leave us...
