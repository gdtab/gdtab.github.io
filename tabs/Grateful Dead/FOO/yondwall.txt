Look Over Yonder's Wall
Arthur Cruddup
Lyrics Only

Darling look on yonder's wall
Hand me down my walking cane
Yes, look on yonder's wall
Hand me down my walking cane
I got to find me another woman
Baby yonder comes your man

Darling I know your man he went to war
I believe he fared mighty tough
Don't know how many men he killed
But I believe he killed enough

Ah do I love you baby
And I love you for myself
Fooling around now with you babe
I can't get nobody else

Yes now that's all right
All right for you
That's all right baby
Any way you do
