E  D   A  (x4)

A                 D              A
Maybe you want to give me kisses sweet
A                D               A
But only for one night with no repeat
A               D             A
Maybe you'd go away and never call
      D                 E                  A    
And a taste of honey is worse than none at all (oh little girl)

Chorus:
                   D                         A
Oh little girl, in that case I don't want no part
D                        A
That would only break my heart
        A           
Oh, but if you feel like loving me 
E              D
If you got the notion
               A
I second that emotion
      A                
Said, if you feel like giving me
  E             D 
A lifetime of devotion
               A
I second that emotion

Intro Chords

Maybe you think that love would tie you down
You ain't got the time to hang around
Maybe you think that love was made for fools
So it makes you wise to break the rules

Chorus
Jam on Verse and Chorus Chords (x2)

Maybe you want to give me kisses sweet
But only for one night with no repeat
Maybe you'd go away and never call
And a taste of honey is worse than none at all (oh little girl)

Chorus

Maybe you think that love would tie you down
You ain't got the time to hang around
Maybe you think that love was made for fools
So it makes you wise to break the rules

Chorus

Well, if you feel like giving me
A lifetime of devotion... (to fade)
