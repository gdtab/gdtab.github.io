Big River
Johnny Cash
Chorus
       A
Well I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry,
                                    B               E
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.
A                                      D
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you big river,
    A                     E7           A
And I'm a gonna sit right here until I die.

  A 
I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota,
    A                                 B                    E
She tore me up everything I heard her drawl, that southern drawl.
       A                                       D
Well I heard my dream went back downstream, cavortin' in Davenport,
      A                E7             A
And I followed you big river when you called.

Chorus

Well I followed her down to St. Louis, later on down the river,
Trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone.
Well I followed her down to Memphis, but she just walked off the bus
She raised a few eyebrows and she went on down alone.

Chorus

Well I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on,
Take that woman down to New Orleans, New Orleans.
I give up, I've had enough, followed my blues on down to the Gulf,
She loves you big river more than me.

Chorus- 2x

And I'm a gonna sit right here 'til I die.
And I'm a gonna sit right here 'til I die.
