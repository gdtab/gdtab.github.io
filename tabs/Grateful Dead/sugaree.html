B                 E
When they come to take you down 
B                    E
When they bring that wagon 'round
B                 E
When they come to call on you 
B                       E
And drag your poor body down

F#m              C#m
Just one thing I ask of you, 
A            E
Just one thing for me
B                 C#m
Please forget you knew my name, 
   A           E
My darling Sugaree

B                 E   
Shake it, shake it sugaree, 
C#m                          A     E
Just don't tell them that you know me
B                 E   
Shake it, shake it sugaree, 
C#m                          A     E
Just don't tell them that you know me
B
|. . . .| . . . .| (x12, short)

You thought you was the cool fool
Never could do no wrong
You had everything sewed up tight.
How come you lay awake all night long?

Chorus
|. . . .| . . . .| (x24, long)

Well in spite of all you gained
You still have to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you
And I guess it's time you go

Chorus
|. . . .| . . . .| (x4, long)

Well shake it up now Sugaree,
I'll meet you at the jubilee
And if that jubilee don't come,
Maybe I'll meet you on the run

The very last time only

C#m                           A    E  B
Just don't tell them that you know-oh me  (x2)
