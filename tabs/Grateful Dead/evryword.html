Every Word You Say
?artist?

I'm no good ?comin'?
I know that's true
I like my silence
I've got my views

But if you feel like talkin', talk away
I'm gonna hang on every word you say

I'm ????
Without a?????
????
???

But if you feel like whisperin', whisper away
I'm gonna hang on every word you say

Sing one of the old songs
You do so well
You lift my spirits
My tollin' bell

But if you feel like singin', sing away
I'm gonna harmonize every word you say
