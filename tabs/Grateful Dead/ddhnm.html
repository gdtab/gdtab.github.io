 Em                  G    B7      Em

        G                   Am   D        G             B
Y' know death don't have no mercy in this land, in this land
Em
Come to your house, you know he don't take long
Am
You look in the bed, you find your mama is gone.
Em                  G    B7       Em
Death don't have no mercy in this land.

I said death don't take no vacation in this land.
Death don't take no vacation in this land, in this land.
Come to your house, no he doesn't stay long.
Look around the room, you see your father will be gone,
Say now death don't, death don't take no vacation in this land.

Jam

Death will leave you standing and crying in this land.
I said death will you standing and crying in this land, in this land
He comes into your house and he don't take long.
You look all around and you find your mother gone.
Death don't have no mercy in this land.

Death don't have no mercy in this land.
Death don't have no mercy in this land, in this land.
Come to your house, you know he don't take long.
You wake up one morning and your whole family be gone
Oh, death don't have no mercy in this land.
