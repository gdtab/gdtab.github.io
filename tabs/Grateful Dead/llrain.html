Looks Like Rain
Weir/Barlow
E      (s.n.)   Ab  AbhA B

E             A     C#m                   F#m
I woke today,       felt your side of the bed;
E               B                           C#m      F#m   E
The covers were still warm where you'd been layin'.
         C#m      D  Bm  A  C#m                      F#m
You were gone, oh gone,     my heart was filled with dread;
E                B              C#m    F#m  E
You might not be sleeping here again.
Asus4      A             Asus4    
But it's alright cause I love you,
A     F#m                     D           A   E
      and that's not going to change.
F#m                       B               E       C#m   G#
Run me around and make me hurt again and again.
C#m    B                   A          
But    I'll still sing you love songs,
E        F#m    B          G#m     C#m     A
 written in the letters of your    name.
E   D                  A            
And brave the storm to come, for it 
F#m               E          D          A        F#m     E
surely looks like rain

Did you ever waken to the sound of street cats making love?
And guess from the cries you were listening to a fight.
Well you know, oh-oh, hate's just the last thing they're thinking of
They're only tryin' to make it through the night.

I only want to hold you, I don't want to tie you down
Or fence you in the lines I might've drawn.
It's just that I, oh I, have gotten used to havin' you around.
The landscape would be empty, if you were gone;
But it's alright cause I love you, and that's not going to change.
Run me around and make me hurt again and again.
But I'll still sing you love songs, 
	written in the letter of your name.
And brave the storm to come, for it surely looks like rain.
