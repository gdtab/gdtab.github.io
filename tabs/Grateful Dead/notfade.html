I wanna tell you how it's gonna be, 
E                                 
You're gonna give your love to me,
E                               A     D A
I wanna love you night and day, 
E
You know my love not fade away.
E
You know my love not fade away, 
                 A
Not fade away!



My love is bigger than a Cadillac, 
I try to show you but you drive me back,
Your love for me has got to be real, 
Your gonna know just how I feel.
A love is real, not fade away,
Not fade away!



I wanna tell you how it's gonna be, 
You're gonna give your love to me,
I'm wanna love you night and day,
You know our love will not fade way.
You know my love not fade away, 
Not fade away!
