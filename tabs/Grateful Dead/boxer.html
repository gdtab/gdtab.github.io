The Boxer
Paul Simon

C             Am
I am just a poor boy though my story's seldom told
       G
I have squandered my resistance
      G7             G6C
For a pocket full of mumbles, such are promises

             Am            G F
All lies and jest, still a man hears what he wants to hear
   C     G  G7  G6  C
And disregards the rest
C       Am
When I left my home and my family, I was no more than a boy

       G
In the company of strangers
       G7         G6               C
In the quiet of a railway station, running scared
       Am           G              F
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters

        C
Where the ragged people go
        G              G7   G6         C
Looking for the places only they would know
Am G Am G F C
Lie la lie Lie la lie Lie la lie Lie la lie Lie la lie

C Am
Asking only workman's wages I come looking for a job
             G
But I get no offers
       G7               G6C
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue

       AmGF
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
    C
I took some comfort there
G  G7  G6  C
Lie lie lie lie la

Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone
Going home where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me, going home.

In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
And he carries a reminder ov ev'ry glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out in his anger and his shame

I am leaving, I am leaving
But the fighter still remains
Lie la lie ... etc.
