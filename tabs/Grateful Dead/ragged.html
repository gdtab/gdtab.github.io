Ragged But Right
Riley Puckett

I just called up to tell you that I'm ragged* but right;
Thief and a gamblin' man, drunk every night.
I eat porterhouse steak three times a day for my board,
That's more than any ordinary man can afford.

I've got pretty little gals layin' 'round at my feet,
Big electric fan to keep me cool when I sleep;
I'm a ramblin' man, a gamblin' man, and Lord! Am I tight!
I just called up to tell you that I'm ragged but right.

I left a pretty little gal layin' there on the floor
Gave her all my love, and who could ask me for more?
Gave her my last quarter just to buy her a drink,
Showed her to the door, and then... What do you think?

I said, "Go home to your mother, and tell her for me
I'm hittin' the road just 'cause I want to be free.
'Cause I'm a ramblin' man, a gamblin' man, and Lord! Am I tight!
I just called up to tell you that I'm ragged but right.

Ragged But Right
Riley Puckett

I come here to tell you people I'm ragged but right
I'm a thief and a gambler, I get drunk every night
I get a porterhouse steak three times a day for my board
That's more than any loafer in this town can afford

A big electric fan to keep me cool while I sleep
A little baby girl plays around at my feet
I'm a ramblin' gambler and I'm drunk every night
I tell you boys I'm ragged but right

Chorus:
I go everywhere, I don't pay no fare
I can ride a freight train just anywhere
If I win or lose, I don't get no blues
Oh it's gamblin' and rolling for me

I hopped on a freight train in North Caroline
Rode down to Atlanta and bought me some 'shine
Went into a card game with 39 cents
Came out with enough for another month's rent

Well you may think I'm bragging but don't get me wrong
I can't run for office while I'm singing this song
I'm a thief and a gambler and I'm drunk every night
I tell you boys I'm ragged but right.
