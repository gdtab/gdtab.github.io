Cryptical Envelopment (He Had To Die)
Garcia
Lyrics Only

The other day they waited, the sky was dark and faded,
Solemnly they stated, "He has to die, you know he has to die."

All the children learnin', from books that they were burnin',
Every leaf was turnin' ; to watch him die, you know he had to die.

The summer sun looked down on him, his mother could but frown on him,
And all the others sound on him, but it doesn't seem to matter.

And when the day had ended, with rainbow colors blended,
His mind remained unbended, he had to die, you know he had to die.

And when the day had ended, with rainbow colors blended,
Their minds remained unbended,

He had to die, Oh, you know he had to die.
