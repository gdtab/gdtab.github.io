Blueberry Hill
Fats Domino
           F
I found my thrill
             C
On Blueberry Hill
             G7
On Blueberry Hill
              C
Where I found you

The moon stood still
On Blueberry Hill
And lingered till
My dreams came true

    G           C
The wind in the willow played
       G7         C
Love's sweet melody
    B7           Em      B7 Em
But all of those vows we made
     B7       E   G7
Were never to be

tacet      F
Tho' we're apart
                  C
You're part of me still
                G7
For you were my thrill
             C
On Blueberry Hill
