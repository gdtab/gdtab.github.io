Drifting Too Far From Shore
Traditional
Out on the perilous deep,
where danger silently creeps,
and storm's so violently sweeping,
You're drifting too far from shore.

Chorus:
Drifting too far from shore,
You're drifting too far from shore,
Come to Jesus today,
Let Him show you the way.
You're drifting too far from shore,

Today, the Tempest rose high,
and clouds o'ershadow the sky.
Sure death is hovering nigh,
You're drifting too far from shore.

Chorus

Why meet a terrible fate?
Mercies abundantly wait.
Turn back before it's too late
You're drifting too far from shore.
