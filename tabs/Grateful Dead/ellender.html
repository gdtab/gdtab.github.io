Fair Ellender
Traditional

Father oh father come riddle to me, 
Come riddle it all as one,
And tell me whether to marry fair Ellen, 
Or bring the brown girl home

The brown girl she has house and land, 
Fair Ellender she has none,
And there I charge you with the blessing, 
To bring the brown girl home

He got on his horse and he rode and he rode, 
He rode 'til he came to her home,
And no one ase ready as fair Ellen herself, 
To rise and bid him in.

What news have you brought unto me, Lord Thomas?  
What news have you brought unto me?
I've come to invite you to my wedding,
A sorrowful wedding to be.

Mother, oh mother, would you go or stay?
Fair child do as you please.
I'm afraid if you go, you'll never return,
To see your dear mother anymore.

She turned around all dressed in white,
Her sisters dressed in green.
And every town that she rode through,
Took her to be some queen.

They rode and they rode 'til they came to the hall,
She pulled on the bell and it rang.
And no one se ready as Lord Thomas himself,
To rise and welcome her in.

He taking her by her lily white hand,
And leading her through the hall.
Saying, "Fifty gay ladies are here today,
"But here is the flower of all."

The brown girl she was standing by,
With knife ground keen and sharp.
Between the long ribs and the short,
She pierced fair Ellender's heart.

Lord Thomas he was standing by,
With knife ground keen and sharp.
Between the long ribs and the short,
He pierced his own bride's heart.

By placing the handle against the wall,
The point against his breast,
Saying, "This is the end of three true lovers,
"God send us all to rest."

Father oh father go dig my grave,
Go dig it wide and deep,
And place fair Ellender in my arms,
The brown girl at my feet.
