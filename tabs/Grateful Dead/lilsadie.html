Dm
Went down last night to take a look around
C                               Am
Met little Sadie and I blew her down, 
Am
Went right home, went to bed
Am                              Dm
Forty-four colt smokes under my head

And I began to think what a deed I'd done
Grabbed my hat and away I run, 
Made a good run, but a little too slow
They overtook me in Jericho

I'm standin' on the corner ringin' the bell
Along came the sheriff from Thomasville
Says "Young man, your name's Brown,
Remember the night you blew Sadie down?"

Oh, yes sir, my name is Lee,
I murdered little Sadie in the first degree
First degree and the second degree
Got any papers won't you read 'em to me.

They took me downtown all dressed in black
Put me on the train and sent me back
Sent me back to the county jail, 
I had nobody to go for my bail

The judge and the jury they took the stand
The judge hold the paper in his right hand
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
Forty-one years to wear the ball and stripes.
