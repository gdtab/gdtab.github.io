Rocky Raccoon
Lennon/McCartney
     Am7             
Now, somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
              D7                              G
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon, ah
                 G7                  C
And one day, his woman ran off with another guy
C/B                    Am7
Hit young Rocky in the eye
                                   D7
Rocky didn't like that, said, "I'm gonna get that boy"
        G  
So, one day he walked into town, 
G7                           C                C/B
Booked himself a room at the local saloon

    Am7                   D7
And Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
G       G7            C       C/B
Only to find Gideon's bible

Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot of the legs of his rival

His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy

Her name was McGill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy

Now, she and her man who called himself Dan
Where in the next room at the Hoedown

Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said, "Danny boy, this is a show-down"

But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner

Doo-doo-doo-da-doo-da-doo

Now, the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table

He said, "Rocky, you met your match"
Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better Doc, 
As soon as I'm able"

Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible

Gideon checked out and he left it, no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival.
