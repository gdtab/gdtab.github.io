Heart Of Stone
Jagger/Richards
Intro:     Dm7    C    Dm7   C

F               C                    F  
There's been so many girls that I've known,
D                      G
I've made so many cry, and still I wonder why,
Am                       G  Am
Here comes a little girl,     I see her walkin' down the street,
G  Am                     G  Am
     She's all by herself,     I try to knock her off her feet,
              F                                              G  
'Cause you'll never break, never break, never break, never break,
              Am                                C           G    
This heart of stone, oh no, no, this heart of stone darlin'.

What's different about her I don't really know,
No matter how I try, I just can't make her cry.

Instrumental Break
G  Am   G   Am   G   Am

'Cause you'll never break, never break, never break, never break,
This heart of stone, oh no, no, this heart of stone darlin'.

Don't keep on lookin' that same old way, 
If you try actin' sad, you'll only make me glad
Better listen little girl, If you goin' walkin' down the street
I ain't got no love, I ain't the kind to meet
'Cause you'll never break, never break, never break, never break,
This heart of stone, oh no, no, this heart of stone darlin'.
