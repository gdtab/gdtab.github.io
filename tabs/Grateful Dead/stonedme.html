And It Stoned Me
Van Morrison
 
G                    D                    C                 G
Half a mile from the county fair, and the rain came pouring down
G            D                     C             G
Me and Billy standing there with a silver half a crown
G             D                     C             G
Hands full of fishing gear, and the tackle on our backs
G                   D                     C                 G
We just stood there getting wet, with our backs against the fence
 
Chorus:
Am      D
Oh, the water
Am      D
Oh, the water
Am      D       Em
Oh, the water
                        D arpeggio
Let it run all over me
G                C           G
And it stoned me to my soul
G                   D
Stoned me just like jelly roll
       Em     G
And it stoned me
G                C            G
And it stoned me to my soul
G              D
Stoned me just going home
       Em     G
And it stoned me
 
And the rain let up, and the sun came out, we were getting dry
Almost glad a pickup truck nearly passed us by
So we jumped right in and the 
	driver grinned and he dropped us up the road
We looked at the swim, and we 
	jumped right in not to mention fishing poles
 
Chorus
 
On the way back home we sang a song, 
	but our throats were getting dry
Then we saw the man from across the road 
	with the sunshine in his eyes
Well he lived all alone in his 
	own little home with a great big gallon jar
There were bottles too, one for me and you, 
	and he said "Hey there you are"
 
Chorus
