Walk In The Sunshine
Weir/Barlow

A7
Look out cause here comes some free advice.
C                     A7            Em
Walk in the sunshine, watch for the bright sun,
C            D                     A7
Be all those things you're able to be.

           Bm            D
You got to listen to the heavens, 
           G       G/F# Em    Em/D
You got to try and understand,
A7
The greatness of their movement 
A7
Is just as small as it is grand.

Try not to hurry, it's just not your worry.
Leave it to those all caught up in time.
You got to deep-six your wristwatch, 
You got to try and understand,
The time it seems to capture 
Is just the movement of its hands.

G       C                         G
I ain't preachin', 'cause I don't know
G           C                      G
How to make fast things move along slow
        C                      A7
I can't stop it, can't make it go.
A7
Just 'cause I say it, that don't mean that it's so, no, no,

Watch what you hear now, make sure it's clear now,
Just 'cause it's said that don't mean that it's true.
So all we say:
You got to make a revolution, 
You got to help me with my cause.
You got to burn down all the buildings, 
You got to rub out all the laws.

C                A7                   Em
I ain't burning, Lord, I'm still only learning
C                         A7      Em
How to become a man of my own.

        A7    Em        A7     Em
I ain't crazy, nor am I lazy,
A7                Em                          A7     Em
Just want to find out what's right and what's wrong.

I ain't burnin', whole world keeps on turning,
I'm still trying to find out what's right and what's wrong.

I ain't crazy!
