It Doesn't Matter
Mydland / Barlow
Lyrics Only

Finished up my masterpiece, gave it to the thought-police.
Want a two-way ticket for a one-way ride.
Nothing lasts nor ever will
You get born, then you're over the hill
Try you might, but no one's leavin' alive.

They say what goes up will always come back down.
Looks to me like it just goes around and around and around.

It doesn't matter, doesn't matter.
It's alright, it's alright.
The universe is workin' fine tonight.
It doesn't matter, doesn't matter.
It's OK.
Whatever comes to pass, will just pass right on away.

The future is a sea of dreams
The past a pack of lies it seems.
Walk in glory or crawl to fame
I only own the surrounding minute
Borrowin' everything that's in it.
Step out on the stage and lose your name.

They say what goes up will always come back in
I don't know, I just like to watch it spin and spin and spin.

It doesn't matter, doesn't matter.
Have a little faith.
I burn my maps so I can navigate.
It doesn't matter, doesn't matter.
Have a little hope.
You can't see tomorrow with a telescope.

We tear down nations with fists and rages
For a paragraph on history's pages.
See those towers in the desert, torn in half.
Whenever you mention Destiny,
You better get rid of that capital D.
Whenever Man plans, it makes God laugh.

Where all this is heading, I can't even guess.
I close my eyes and I just say, "yes,"
I say, "yes, yes, yes."

It doesn't matter, doesn't matter.
Gotta be here now.
Gotta learn to live in the present somehow.
It doesn't matter, doesn't matter.
Your big designs look mighty damned small
In the endless halls of time.
