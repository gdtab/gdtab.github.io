You Ain't Goin' Nowhere
Bob Dylan
D                Em
Clouds so swift, rain won't lift,
G                      D
Gates won't close, the railing's froze.
                  Em
Get your mind off winter time,
G                 D
You ain't goin' nowhere.

Chorus
D            Em
Oooo, Eeeee, Ride me high,
G                    D
One of these days my man's gonna come.
         Em
Oh Lord, we gonna fly,
G                D
Down in the easy chair.

I don't care how many letters they sent,
Morning came and morning went.
Pick up your money and pack your tent,
But we still ain't goin' nowhere.

Chorus

Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots,
Tailgates and substitutes,
Strap yourself with the tree with roots,
You ain't goin' nowhere.

Chorus

Ghengis Khan he could not keep
All his kings supplied with sleep.
Climb that hill no matter how steep,
We still ain't goin' nowhere.

Chorus
