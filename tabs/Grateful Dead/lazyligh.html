Lazy Lightening, sleepy fire in your eyes,
                  Fmaj7     C
Is that desire in disguise?
                     Em*
I keep on tryin' but I, I can't get through

Lazy Lightening, I'd like to find the proper potion
To kinda capture your emotion
You're right beside me but I, I can't get through

Am
You're a loop of Lazy Lightening,

Liquid loop of Lazy Lightening,

Must admit you're kinda frightening,

But you really get me high.

Frozen lightening, when I hear your velvet thunder
You seem so near I start to wonder
Would you come closer if I, if I asked you to?

So inviting, well, you're messin' with my reason
It's an obsession but it's pleasin'
Tell me your lie and I will swear, I'll swear it's true

You're a loop of Lazy Lightening,
Liquid loop of Lazy Lightening,
Must admit you're kinda frightening,

Rope of fire 'round my heart   (Lightening)
                     G
Rope of fire ever   (tightening)
                       D
Rope of fire 'round my heart
                       Em           C      G   F   C      Am
Come on, come on, lazy lightening
Am
You're a loop of Lazy Lightening,  Whooo

Lazy Lightening, I see you'll never strike the same place
Lord, the devil knows in my case
I'd black out if I thought, thought that would do

Misty Lightening, you always 'lectrified me,
Someday I know you'll satisfy me
And all that lightening will be my lightening, too
Am
My lightening too

Supplication

D      Fmaj7

D
(Whoo-hoo-hoo) Dizzy ain't the word for the way that you're
Fmaj7
Makin' me feel now
D
(Whoo-hoo-hoo) I need some indication if 
Fmaj7
All of this is real now
D
(Whoo-hoo-hoo) I've heard it said there could be something
Fmaj7
Wrong in my head, now
D
(Whoo-hoo-hoo) Could it be infatuation or am I just
Fmaj7
Bein' mislead, now
                    D                           Fmaj7
Little bolt of inspiration, right beside me now
                 D                      Fmaj7
Sparkin' my imagination, lightening now
                    D                                    Fmaj7
Causin' instant excitation, cause you're frightening now
                      D                          Fmaj7
Come to heed my supplication, got to have it now
              D                  Fmaj7
My light'nin' too, My light'nin' too
