If I Lose, Let Me Lose
Traditional
AIR: Battleship Maine, White House Blues

D
I can't walk, neither can I talk
G
Just gettin' back from the state of old New York
A7            D
One morning before day

Flossie, oh Flossie, now what is the matter
Walked all the way from old Cincinatta
One morning before day

Chorus: 
D
If I lose, let me lose
A7               D
I don't care how much I lose
D                           G
If I lose a hundred dollars while I'm tryin' to win a dime
A7 D
For my baby, she needs money all the time

The blood was a-runnin', and I was runnin' too
Give my feet some exercise, I had nothing else to do
One morning before day

Chorus

The peas was so greasy, the meat was so fat
The boys was fightin' the Spaniards while I was fightin' gnats
One morning before day

Chorus

See them girls settin' at the tank
Ready to catch a freight train they call old Nancy Hanks
One morning before day

Chorus
