Boogie On, Reggae Woman
Stevie Wonder

I'd like to see you go right across the floor
I'd like to do it to ya till you holler for more
I'd like to reggae but you dance too fast for me
I'd like to make love to you till you ???? use me

Boogie on, reggae woman
What is up, what is wrong with you
Boogie on, reggae woman
Baby what you going to do

I'd like to see the both of us fall deeply in love
I'd like to see you now in the stars above
I'd like to see the both of us fall deeply in love
I'd like to see you raw in the stars above

Boogie on, reggae woman
What is up, what is wrong with you
Boogie on, reggae woman
Baby what you going to do

I'd like to see the both of us fall deeply in love
I'd like to see you now in the stars above
I'd like to see the both of us fall deeply in love
I'd like to see you now in the stars above

Boogie on, reggae woman
What is up, what is wrong with you
Boogie on, reggae woman
Baby what you going to do
Boogie on, reggae woman
What is up, what is wrong with you
Boogie on, reggae woman
Baby what you going to do
