Visions of Johanna
Bob Dylan
Capo 2nd Fret
Intro: G  C D7  G
                                     C                  D7              G
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're tryin' to be so quiet?
                                   C             D7        G
We sit here stranded, though we're all doin' our best to deny it
        D7                                            G
And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin' you to defy it
       C                         G
Lights flicker from the opposite loft
   C                             G
In this room the heat pipes just cough
    C                           G
The country music station plays soft
                                             D7
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off
        G           C     D7   G
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
          C            G          D7         G       C  G
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.

In the empty lot where the ladies play blind man's bluff with the key chain
And the allnight girls, they whisper of escapades out on the "D" train
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
Ask himself if it's him or them that's realy insane
Louise, she's allright, she's just near
She's delicate and seems like the mirror
But she just makes it all too concice and too clear
That Johanna's not here
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.

Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
And when bringing her name up He speaks of a farewell kiss to me
He's sure got a lotta gall
to be so useless and all
Muttering small talk at the wall
while I'm in the hall
How can I explain? Oh, it's so hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.

Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues You can tell by the way she smiles
See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jellyfaced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeeze, I can't find my knees"
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna they make it all seem so cruel.


The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him
Sayin' "Name me someone that's not a parasite
and I'll go out and say a prayer for him." But like Louise
always says, "Ya can't look at much can ya man?" As she herself prepares for him
And Madonna, she still has not showed
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps to the road
He writes ev'rything's been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish truck that loads While my conscience explodes
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.
