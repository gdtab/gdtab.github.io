Off To Sea Once More
Ewan MacColl/Traditional
     Dm              C    Am
When first I came to Liverpool
	  Dm    C     Am
	I went upon a spree
   Dm            F
Me money alas, I spent it fast
	    F        C           A7
	Got drunk as drunk could be
    Dm            F
And when my money was all gone
	      F      C      A7
	'Twas then I wanted more
      Dm                   C           Am
But a man must be blind to make up his mind
	   Dm    C        Dm
	To go to sea once more

When first I came to Liverpool, 
	I went upon a spree,
Me money alas I spent it fast, 
	got drunk as drunk could be.
And when my money was all gone, 
	'twas then I wanted more.
But a man must be blind to make up his mind 
	to go to sea once more.

I spent that night with Angeline, 
	too drunk to roll in bed,
My watch was new and my money too, 
	in the mornin' with 'em she fled.
And as I roamed the streets about, 
	the whores they all would roar,
Here comes Jack Rack, the poor sailor lad, 
	he must go to sea once more.

As I was walkin' down the street, 
	I met with Rapper Brown,
I asked for him to take me in, 
	and he looked at me with a frown.
He said, "Last time you was paid off, 
	with me you jobbed no score,
But I'll take your advance, and I'll give ya's a chance,
	and I'll send you to sea once more.

I hired me aboard of a whaling ship, 
	bound for the Arctic seas,
Where the cold winds blow through the frost and the snow, 
	and Jamaican rum would freeze.
And worst and bear I'd no hard weather gear, 
	for I'd lost all my money ashore,
'Twas then that I wished that I was dead, 
	and gone to sea no more.

Some days we're catching whales me lads, 
	and some days we're catching none,
With a twenty foot oar stuck in our hands 
	from four o'clock in the morn,
And when the shades of night come on, 
	we rest on our weary oar,
'Twas then that I wished that I was dead, 
	or safe with the girls ashore.

Come all you bold seafaring men,
	and listen to my song,
When you come off of them long trips,
	I'd have ya's not go wrong,
Take my advice, take no strong drink,
	don't go sleeping with no whores,
Get married lads and have all night in,
	and go to sea no more.
