Look Away                      
Robert Hunter

from Mickey Hart's Mystery Box

Remember the song of the morning
Remember how good it could be
Remember what you always wanted
The World & some way to be free

Thunder at mid-night a-rattles the glass
Reminders in lightning: all things shall Pass...........away...away
 
Forget it and whisper in sweet harmony
The rapture of wind in a storm out at sea
 
Away , Away , Away , Look Away 
Away , Away , Away , Look Away         
 
The hole in the pocket, the rip in the sleeve
All of the reasons we seek to believe
Something must come of the loss & the pain 
Faith may be madness but doubt is insane

One of these nights when opportunity
Beats on the door like the drum of the Moon.....away...away.....
 
Break free of the moment, rear back & leap
Roll like the wind on the face of the deep

Away , Away , Away , Look Away 
Away , Away , Away , Look Away         

Remember the song of the evening
Remember how sad it could be
The fear that rose with the thin crescent moon
That we  might never be free
          
Fear dies away with the morning
Sunlight dissolves it to mist....away - away...........
 
Leaving as some kind of warning
The dark hand of faith to be kissed
Away , Away , Away , Look Away 
Away , Away , Away , Look Away         
 
This is the land that was spoken about
In the deep heart of music without any doubt
They call it forever, they call it a day
It's neither of those -- it just feels that way
 
With you by my side & the child of our love
Ride on the waves while the stars shine Above....away.....away.......
 
Ride on the stars while the waves crash below
Loving each other -- away we will go
Away , Away , Away , Look Away 
Away , Away , Away , Look Away         

Away , Away , Away , Look Away 
Away , Away , Away , Look Away
