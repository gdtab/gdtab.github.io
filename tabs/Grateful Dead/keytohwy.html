          A           E
I got the  key to the  highway,
D
 Billed out and bound to go.
          A
I'm gonna  leave here running;
E                   A      DAE
 Walking's much too  slow.
          A            E
I'm going  back to the  border
D
 Woman, where I'm better known.
             A
You know you  haven't done nothing,
E                           A      DAE
 Drove a good man away from  home.
         A                    E
When the  blue peeks over the  mountains
D
 I'll be on my way.
          A
I'm gonna  roam this old highway
E                   A     DAE
 Until the break of  day.
           A                   E
Oh give me  one, one more kiss  mama
D
 Just before I go,
              A
'Cause when I  leave this time you know I,
E                   A      DAE
 I won't be back no  more.

I got the key to the highway, I'm booked out and bound to go,
          A              E    E7                   A     E7
I'm gonna leave here running, ain't coming back no more

I'm going back to the border, where I'm better known, 
I'm gonna ride this old highway, ain't coming back no more

Give me one more kiss, mama, just before I go, 
I'm gonna leave here running, ain't coming back no more

Now, when the moon peeks over the mountain, yeah.. 
		
You know I'll be on my way
I'm gonna walk, walk this ol' highway, deep until the break of day

So long and good-bye, yes, I had to say good-bye,
'Cause I'm gonna walk, walk this ol' highway, 
		deep 'til the day I die
