Silver Threads and Golden Needles
D.Reynolds/J.Rhodes

  C  F
I grew up in ragged gingham, where love is a sacred thing
C   G
You grew up in silk and satins, where love's just a passing thing
  C    F
I know now you never loved me, oh I know I was just a fool
  C GC   C7
To think your pride would let you play love by the golden rule

Chorus
  F C
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine
G
And I dare not drown my sorrow in the warm glow of your wine
 C F
You can't buy my love with money 'cause I ain't never been that kind
  C G  C
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine

Jam

I don't want your lonely mansion with a tear in every room
All I want's the love you've promised once beneath the haloed moon
But you think I should be happy with your money and your name
Sit alone and bide my sorrows while you play love's cheating game

Chorus

  F C
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine
Bb F G
And I dare not drown my sorrow in the warm glow of your wi---ne
F CF
You can't buy my love with money 'cause I ain't never been that kind
  C G  C
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine

Chorus
C7F C
Silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine
Bb F G
And I dare not drown my sorrow in the warm glow of your wi---ne
F CF
You can't buy my love with money 'cause I ain't never been that kind
  C Bb F G  F  C
Silver threads and golden needles cannot me--and this heart of mine
