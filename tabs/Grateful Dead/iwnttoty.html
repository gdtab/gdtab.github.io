I want to tell you, my head is filled w/ things to say
E7                                               A7
When you here, all those words they seem to slip away.

When I get near you, The games begin to drag me down,
It's alright, I'll make you maybe next time around.

Bm                      A
Well if I seem to act unkind,
          B              Bm
It's only me it's not my mind,
           A
That is confusing things.

I want to tell you, I feel hung up  but i don't know why.
It's alright, I could wait forever, I got time.

Sometimes I wish I knew you well,
So I could speak my mind and tell you,
Maybe you'd understand.

I want to tell you, I feel hung up  but i don't know why.
It's alright, I could wait forever, I got time.

A7
I got time,
