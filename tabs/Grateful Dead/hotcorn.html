Upstairs, downstairs, out in the kitchen 
D
Upstairs, downstairs, out in the kitchen
G
Upstairs, downstairs, out in the kitchen
G
I met an old cook just a reelin' and a pitchin' 
G
Yes sir.

Chorus:
Hot Corn, cold corn, bring along the demijohn {x3}
Fair thee well, uncle Bill see you in the morning, 
Yes sir.

Old aunt Sally, won't you fill'em up again {x3}
I ain't had a drink since the lord knows when 
Yes sir.

Chorus

All I need to keep me happy
Is two little boys to call me Pappy
One named Paul and one named Davy
One likes ham and the other loves gravy
Yes sir.

Chorus

Preacher's in the pulpit takin' in the money
Children in the bee hive takin' in the honey
Old aunt Sally just a jumpin' for joy
Happiest lot of people that ever I saw
Yes sir.

Chorus

Preacher's all a comin'
And the children are a cryin' {x3}
Chicken heads a-wringin' and a toe nails flyin'
Yes sir.

Chorus
