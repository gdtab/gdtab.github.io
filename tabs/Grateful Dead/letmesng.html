Let Me Sing Your Blues Away

      Bb
Gonna hop in the hack then turn on the key,
F                                      Bb 
Pop in the clutch, let the wheels roll free,

Eb   Ab7    G7   Gb7   F7

      Bb
Not a cloud in the sky, such a sunny day,
F                                   Bb
Push in the button, let the top ten play.

Bb
Come on honey, let me sing 'em away,
F
Come on honey, let me sing 'em away,
Bb  Bb7           Eb        Ebm    Bb        D7
Oh, honey, let me sing your blues away.

G                                 C
Give me a little of that old time love,
      A7                       D7
Cause I ain't never had near enough.
        G                  E7         A7     C7
Honey, walk that walk with style and grace,
G             G#7                 C#m
This ain't no knock-down drag-out race.

A                              Bm/A
It don't matter much, pick any gear,
A
Grind you a pound and drop the rear.
                      Bm
Baby, baby what can I say,
A                              G/D      D
I'm here to drive those blues away.

B
I sent a letter to a man I know,
B
Said, "One for the money and two for the show."
B
I wait all summer for his reply
       A                      E
Said, "Three to get ready and four to fly."

C#
Only two things in the world I love,
       A                    D             F
That's rock 'n' roll and my turtle dove.

                                 Eb/G 3 x 1 3 4 0
Bb                 F/A  Eb/G    F/A         Bb
When I was a young man        I needed good luck,
Cm7                    Dm7           Bb/D          F
But I'm a little bit older now and I know my stuff.

Bb
Come on honey, let me sing 'em away,
F
Come on honey, let me sing 'em away,
Bb  Bb7           Eb        Ebm   Bb
Oh, honey, let me sing your blues away.
