No matter how hard I fight it

Baby, I'm still in love with you

If you're ever in need, there's no limit to what I'll do
I'll work eight days a week baby, and give it all to you

That's what love will do for you
That's what love will make you do
No matter how hard I fight it
Baby, I'm still in love with you
