Picasso Moon
Weir / Barlow
Lyrics Only

South of Market in the land of ruin
You'll find all manner of action,
Tinsel tigers in the Metal Room,
Stalking satisfaction.
They got 'em packaged up for love and money
Tattooed tots and chrome spike bunnies
I found my mirrored shades ready to see
And roll on in, gonna roll in it, honey

I get a feeling like when big things collide
?    Crack a fub of thunder like I'm really on high
?    Here comes middle ages, she looks ready to ride
What's that she's trying to show me?
What's that she's trying to show me?

Picasso moon, shattered light
Diamond bullets ripping up the night
Picasso moon, liberate me.
Ah, life's infinite diversity.
Great amazing majesty.
And it's bigger than a drive-in movie, oooh wee
Bigger than a drive-in movie, oooh wee.

Hangin' ten out on space and time,
Redefining distance.
The next skull on your necklace is mine,
Cheap for such assistance.
I had a job trading bits for pieces.
We'd make wrinkles, advertise them as creases.
Please find my resignation enclosed.
Roll in it, come on let's roll in it, honey.

Dark Angel, what's botherin' you?
?    Some stranger do me all that you do.
?    Dark Angel, you making it blue.
I guess it doesn't matter.
I guess it doesn't matter.

?    Picasso moon, widening ball.
?    I feel a quake and ding I hear the call
?    Picasso moon, river sky
Amazing, blazing, mystify.
?    It's, rude a wind, I wanna fly
And it's bigger than a drive-in movie, oh my.
Bigger than a drive-in movie, oh my.

Strikes the morning, the atomic dawn,
Scramble back to cover.
Quick, pop your mirrored sunglasses on,
My little leather-winged lover.
I see your face printed on my money.
?    Your blazing ways really move me, honey.
?    Harder days, yeah yeah.
Why'm I laughing? This ain't funny?

Dark angel, now just don't start.
You break my spirit, you break my heart.
You must have a license for practicing that art
?    That don't presume to magic
?    No I, don't presume to magic

Picasso moon, fractal flame
Blazing lace filling every frame
Picasso moon, wheels within wheels
?    The bells are ringin', it's quite unreal
Trying to tell y'all about just how I feel
And it's bigger than a drive-in movie, for real.
Bigger than a drive-in movie, for real.

Picasso moon, shattered light
Diamond bullets ripping up the night
Picasso moon, liberate me.
?    Picasso moon, widening ball
?    I feel the quake and ding I hear the call
Picasso moon, fill the sky
Picasso moon, fractal flame
Blazing lace filling every frame
Picasso moon, wheels within wheels
Picasso moon, shining bright
The universe is working fine tonight
Picasso moon, illuminate me
