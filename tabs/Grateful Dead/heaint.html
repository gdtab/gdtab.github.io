Little Girl, Lord you know it's true

I give my life for you baby, 
D                              A        D         A
If I thought you'd love me the way that I love you

I've done more for you than your daddy's ever done
I've done more for you than your daddy's ever done
I give you my heart and my soul, baby
He ain't give you none

And I wonder 
Are you gonna, are you gonna let me stand alone
Are you gonna, are you gonna let me stand alone
I caught you early this morning, baby
Before your daddy came home

Don't you ever go down, down, down, down, down, 
Over on Way street
Don't you ever go down, down, down, down, down, 
Over on Way street
Nothin' but heartaches there baby 
With the kinda guy you plan to meet

I've done more for you than your daddy's ever done
I've done more for you than your daddy's ever done

He Ain't Give You None
Words and music by Van Morrison

Little gal, little girl 
Lord, you know it's true 
Little gal, little girl, 
Lord, you know it's true, 
I don't want to stop 
Rockin' and rollin' with you. 
Are you gonna let me stand alone, 
Are you gonna let me stand alone, 
Caught you this mornin' 
Before your Daddy came home. 
And I've done more for you 
Than your Daddy has ever done, 
I've done more for you 
Than your Daddy has ever done 
Gave you my jelly roll
And he ain't give you none. 
 
Don't you ever go down 
Down on Kersian Street, It'd bad 
Don't you ever go down 
Down on Kersian Street 
That's where old John 
Flogs his daily meat 
Maybe sometime he says leave the 
Little boy and the girl behind 
I got messed up round somewhere 
Called the Nottinghill Gate 
I lived there for awhile 
But I moved out 
And when I moved out 
I was in such a state 
I've never gone back there, but 
I'm sure I done more for you 
Than you Daddy has ever done baby 
Made you learn your syllables. 
Done more for you 
Than your Daddy has ever done 
Gave you my jelly roll 
And he ain't give you none.
