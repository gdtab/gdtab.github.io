It's A Long Long Way
as performed on 24th of Feb 1992
Hunter/Bralove

Who do you think you are?
what do you mean when you put us all down
walking round in circles
your nose to the ground
you think you're saying some
because you're makin a sound
you say you've seen it all
you don't care to see no more
but you don't get up an go
until they throw you out the door
it's a long long long long way to go home
it's a long long long long way to go home
any which way you are tempted to go
it's a long long long long long long way
way to go home

who do remind me of
what do you do
when you do your own time
did you run away
from the scene of your crime
i feel as though i know you
could you spare me a dime
...prison
but it's more than a jail
i'll tell you all about it
but that's another day
it's a long long long long way to go home
it's a long long long long way to go home
any which way you are tempted to go
it's a long long long long long long long long way
way to go home

Bridge

you say you've seen it all
you don't care to see no more
but behind that you've been hopeless
..the sick and the poor
you say you've seen enough
to last you all your days
...
....

who do you want to be?
what do you need
to set your body free
i don't mean to pry
...the third degree
but looking at you me baby
you remind myself of me
if there's anyway to tell you
anyway you can say
...spare you
...
it's a long long long long way to go home
it's a long long long long way to go home
any which way you are tempted to go
it's a long long long long long long long long way
way to go home
it's a long long long long way to go home
it's a long long long long way to go home
any which way you are tempted to go
it's a long long long long long long long long way
way to go home
it's a long long long long way to go home
it's a long long long long way to go home
any which way you are tempted to go
it's a long long long long long long long long way
