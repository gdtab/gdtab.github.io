Crazy Love
Van Morrison
A              C#min
I can feel her heartbeat
D               A
from a thousand miles
A               C#min
And the heavens open
D              A
every time she smiles
A                  C#min
And when I come to her
D              A
that's where I belong
A                 C#min
Yeah, I'm running to her
D              A
like a river's song

Chorus:
A                 E    F#min E     D     E
She gives me love love love  love, crazy love
A                 E    F#min E     D     A
She gives me love love love  love, crazy love

She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
And when I come to her when the sun goes down
She take away my trouble take away my grief
Take away my heartache, I go right to sleep 

Chorus

Bridge
  E     D              A
Yes I need her in the daytime
  E     D              A
Yes I need her in the night
  E   D                 A           C#m
Yes I want to throw my arms around her
  E                D                A    E
Kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight

And when I'm returning from so far away
She gives me some sweet lovin' brightens up my day
Yes it makes me righteous, yes it makes me whole
Yes it makes me mellow down into my soul
Chorus x2
