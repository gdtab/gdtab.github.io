I've been tryin' to get to you for a long time
'Cause constantly, you've been on my mind
I was thinking about your 
But I found I made a mistake

Chorus:
I was wrong, it took too long,
I was caught in a shower,n   fellow started to shout
You were the love and affection
Now you won't look in my direction

On the Expressway to your your heart
That expressway, that's the best way

Bridge:
At five o'clock it's much too crowded
Much too crowded...

Well there are too many in back of me
And they're all tryin' to get in front of me
I was thinkin' I saw a road up ahead
But I saw a stoplight instead

Chorus, Bridge
