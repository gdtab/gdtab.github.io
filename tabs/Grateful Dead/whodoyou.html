Who Do You Love
Bo Diddley (Ellis McDaniel)
Lyrics Only

I walk 47 miles of barbed wire
I use a cobra snake for a necktie
I got a house on the roadside made from rattlesnake hide
I got a brand new chimney made on top made out of a human skull
Now, come on take a little walk with me Arlene honey and tell me who do you love

REFRAIN
Who do you love, who do you love
who do you love, who do you love

Tombstone hand and a grave yard mine
Just 22 and I don't mind dyin

refrain

I rode around the town using rattlesnake whip
Take it easy Arlene don't give me no lip

refrain

The night was dark when the sky was blue
Down the alley the ice wagon flew
Hit a bump and somebody screamed
You should a heard just what I seen

refrain

Arlene took me by my hand
She said oo-wee Bo ya know I understand
