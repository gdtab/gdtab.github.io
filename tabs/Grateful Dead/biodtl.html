          B                      E          B
Well this job I've got is just a little too hard,
                                        F#
Running out of money, Lord, I need more pay.
      B                                  E
Gonna wake up in the morning Lord, gonna pack my bags,
          B       G# C#  F#   B    E   B
I'm gonna beat it on down the line.

                   E                   B
I'm goin' down the line, goin down the line,
               F#                  B
Goin' down the line, goin down the line,
               E                   B        G#
Goin' down the line, goin down the line,
B       G# C#  F#   B     E   B
Beat it on down the line.

Yes I'll be waiting at the station Lord, 
	when that train pulls on by,
I'm going back where I belong.
I'm going back to that same old used-to-be,
Down in Joe Brown's coal mine.

Coal mine, coal mine, coal mine, coal mine.
Coal mine, coal mine, coal mine, coal mine.
Coal mine, coal mine, coal mine, coal mine.
Down in Joe Brown's coal mine.

Yeah, I'm goin' back to that shack way across that railroad track,
Uh huh, that's where I think I belong.
Got a sweet woman, Lord, she's waitin' there for me,
And that's where I'm gonna make my happy home.

Happy home, happy home, happy home, happy home.
Happy home, happy home, happy home, happy home.
Happy home, happy home, happy home, happy home.
That's where I'm gonna make my happy home.
