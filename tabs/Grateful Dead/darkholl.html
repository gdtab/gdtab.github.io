Dark Hollow
Bill Browning

(Walk E   F#  G#)  A     E         A			s.n. Bass
I'd rather be in some dark hollow 
          A         D    A
Where the sun don't ever shine
        A           G        D 
Then to be at home alone and knowin' that you're gone
      A           E       A
Would cause me to lose my mind.

CHORUS:
   A         E       A
So blow your whistle freight train 
        A      D        A
Take me far on down the track
    A          G    D         
I'm going away, I'm leaving today
    A            E            A
I'm goin', but I ain't comin' back.


I'd rather be in some dark hollow 
Where the sun don't ever shine
Then to be in some big city, 
In a small room, with you on my mind.

CHORUS

I'd rather be in some dark hollow 
Where the sun don't ever shine
Then to see you another man's darlin'
And to know that you'll never be mine.

CHORUS, repeat last 2 lines
