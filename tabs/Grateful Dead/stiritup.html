On my  mind.

 Now you are here, I said  it's so  clear;

 To see what we can do, baby,  just me and  you.

A                          D           E
 I'll push the wood, yeah,  blaze your  fire,
A                       D          E
 Then I'll satisfy your  heart's desire.
A                          D              E
 Said, I'll stir it, yeah,  every minute.
A                         D           E
 All you got to do, baby,  is keep it  in it.

Chorus

 Oh, will you quench me  when I'm  thirsty?

 Come and cool me down, baby,  when I'm hot?
A                D           E
 Your recipe, darling, is so  tasty,
A             D              E
 And you sure  can stir your  pot, so...
