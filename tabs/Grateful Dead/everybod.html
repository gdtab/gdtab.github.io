We're so glad to see so many of you lovely people here tonight, and we
would especially like to welcome all the representatives of Illinois'
law enforcement community that have chosen to join us here in the
Palace Hotel Ballroom at this time.  We sincerely hope that you all enjoy
the show and please remember people, that no matter who you are, and
whatever you do to live, thrive and survive, there are still some
things that make us all the same:
  you, me, him, them -- everybody, people, everybody!

Sometimes I feel, I feel a little sad inside
When my baby mistreats me, 
I never never have a place to hide, I need you!

hold that man, love him, hold him, squeeze her, please her, hold, squeeze and please that person, give 'em all your love, signify your feelings with every gentle caress, because it's so important to have that special somebody to hold, kiss, miss, squeeze, and please.
