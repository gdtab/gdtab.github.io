Ain't No Use

Song is an 8-bar blues ditty for the verses, one step up for the bridge: 
I    I     IV7   I  
V7   IV7   I     I

Verse:
It ain't no use, for you to cry
Woman you'd better, dry your eyes
You hurt me so, I want you to love me
But it ain't no use, it ain't no use

There was a time, was my pride and joy
Woman I loved you, like a child loves a toy
I love you so, I want you to know
But it ain't no use, it ain't no use

Bridge:
I wanted you
You wanted someone else
You went away and left me
And left me all by my
Left me all by my
Left me all by my
Left me all by myself

Now it's your turn to cry, make no mistake
Woman I loved you, but it's too late
You hurt me so, I want you to know
That it's too late, it's too late

Jam on verse chords until you've reached an altered state of being

It ain't no use, for you to cry
Woman you'd better, dry your eyes
You hurt me so, I want you to love me
But it ain't no use, it ain't no use

There was a time, was my pride and joy
Oman I loved you, like a chile loves a toy
I love you so, I want you to know
But it ain't no use, it ain't no use

Bridge:
I wanted you
You wanted someone else
You went away and left me
And left me all by my
Left me all by my
Left me all by my
Left me all by myself

Now it's your turn to cry, make no mistake
Woman I loved you, but it's too late
You hurt me so, I want you to know
That it's too late, it's too late

You done me wrong, I want you to know
That it's too late, it's too late
You done me wrong, now you want to come home
But it's too late, it's too late
