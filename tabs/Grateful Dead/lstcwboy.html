The Last Cowboy Song
performed by Waylon Jennings/Kris Kristofferson/Johnny Cash/Willie Nelson


Chorus:
           D
	This is the last cowboy song 
                                    G
	The end of a hundred year waltz
              A
	The voices sound sad as they're singing along
                                     D
	Another piece of America is lost


Verse 1:(Waylon Jennings)
            D
	He rides the feed lots,works in a market
                                       A
	On weekend selling tobacco and beer

	He dreams of tommorrow surrounded by fences
                                                        D
	But he'll dream tonight of when fences weren't here


Verse 2:(Kris Kristofferson)
           D
	He blazed the trail with Lewis and Clark
                                                 A
	And eyeball to eyeball old Wyatt backed down

	He stood shoulder to shoulder with Travis in Texas
                                                    D
	And rode with the Seventh when Custer went down

Chorus

Verse 3:(Willie Nelson)
           D
	Remington showed us how he looked on canvas
                                      A
	And Louis Lamour told us his tale

	Me and Johnny and Waylon and Kris sing about him
                                                   D
	And wish to God we could have ridden his trail


Verse 4:(spoken-Johnny Cash) and the three others sing the chorus.
           D
	The old chisom trail is covered in concrete
                                               G
	They truck it to market in fifty foot rigs
           A
	They roll by his graveside and don't even notice
                                               D
	Like living and dying was all he ever did

Chorus
