Cigarettes and Coffee
Jerry Butler/Eddie Thomas/Jay Walker

Intro:
G  G#5  G6  G#5  G

It's early in the morning
About a quarter to three
And I'm sittin' here, talking with my baby
Over cigarettes and coffee
Tell you I don't feel so satisfied
But ever since I've met you
Baby since I met you

All the ladies that I've been around...
All the good looking girls that I met
They just don't seem to pay me any attention
Not at this particular time, 

But it seems so natural darlin'
You and I ought to be in love
Just talkin' over cigarettes an drinkin' coffee

Oh my heart cries out
At last I've found you
But won't you let me
Build my whole life around you

Oh.....how complete how complete 
My whole life would be
If you would take me under consideration,
Walk down this aisle with me
Oh I would love it I would just love it darlin'

I say it's so early in the mornin'
It's a quarter to three
We're just sittin' here
Talkin over ... cigarettes and drinkin' coffee
Oh drinkin' coffee
I'd like to show you
I don't know nothin'...

Since I met you darlin'
Honey since I met you
I'd love to have another oh another drink of coffee
Have another drink of coffee
Have another drink of coffee
Please darlin' please help me smoke
Just one more cigarette
I want to smoke just one more cigarette with you
It's so early in the mornin' baby...
