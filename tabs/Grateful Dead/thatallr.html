That's All Right, Mama
Arthur Crudup
A
My Mama told me, Papa done told me too
A                                 A7
That gal you're foolin' with, she ain't no good for you
           D7            
But that's allright, that's allright
          E7                         A
That's allright now Mama, anyway you do

One and one is two, two and two is four
Don't leave me baby when you walk out the door
That's allright, that's allright
That's allright now Mama, anyway you do

That's allright Mama, that's allright with you
That's allright Mama, anyway you do
