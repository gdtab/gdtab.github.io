Supplication
Weir/Barlow

D      Fmaj7

D
(Whoo-hoo-hoo) Dizzy ain't the word for the way that you're
Fmaj7
Makin' me feel now
D
(Whoo-hoo-hoo) I need some indication if 
Fmaj7
All of this is real now
D
(Whoo-hoo-hoo) I've heard it said there could be something
Fmaj7
Wrong in my head, now
D
(Whoo-hoo-hoo) Could it be infatuation or am I just
Fmaj7
Bein' mislead, now
                    D                           Fmaj7
Little bolt of inspiration, right beside me now
                 D                      Fmaj7
Sparkin' my imagination, lightening now
                    D                                    Fmaj7
Causin' instant excitation, cause you're frightening now
                      D                          Fmaj7
Come to heed my supplication, got to have it now
              D                  Fmaj7
My light'nin' too, My light'nin' too
