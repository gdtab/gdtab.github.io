Bo Diddley
Ellis McDaniels (Bo Diddley)

Hey, Bo Diddley dee.

Bo Diddley buy baby diamond ring
If that diamond ring don't shine
He gonna take it to a private eye
If that private eye can't shake
He'd better not take that ring from me

Bo Diddley caught a nanny goat 
To make his pretty baby a sunday coat
Bo Diddley caught a (fowl?) cat
To make his pretty baby a sunday hat

Won't you come to my house*
A black dress on
Take my baby all the way from home
Up to that bozo? an where yo been 
Up to your house and gone again

Bo Diddley Bo Diddley have ya heard
My pretty baby said that she was a bird


*Not all that sure of the words in this section
