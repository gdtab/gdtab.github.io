P. Rowan

Intro:
A    Asus4
       A E
If you ever feel lonesome when you're down in San Antone

Beg, steal, or borrow two nickels or a dime

And I'll meet you at Alamo Mission, where we can say our prayers.

The Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mother will heal us as we kneel there.

Chorus
       G D       GD
In the moonlight, in the midnight,
       G  D     A
In the moonlight, midnight, moonlight
       G D       GD
In the moonlight, in the midnight,
       G  D      A          A
In the moonlight, midnight, moonlight {x4}

If you ever feel sorrow for the deeds you have done.
With no hope for tomorrow in the setting of the sun.
And the ocean is howling, for the things that might have been.
And that last good morning sunrise
Will be the brightest you've ever seen.

Chorus
Jam:

If you ever feel sorrow for the deeds you have done.
With no hope for tomorrow in the setting of the sun.
And the ocean is howling, for the things that might have been.
And that last good morning sunrise
Will be the brightest you've ever seen.
