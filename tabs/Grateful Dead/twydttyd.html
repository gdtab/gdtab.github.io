You got a smile so bright
                              D      G   D
You know, you could've been a candle
                     D     G    D
I'm holding you so tight
                                D     G   D
You know, you could've been a handle
                             G
The way you swept me off my feet
                                D    G   D
You know, you could've been a broom
                       D    G    D
The way you smell so sweet
                                  D     G    D
You know, you could've been some perfume

D                  A                      G
Well, you could've been anything that you wanted to
          A   G                              D   G   D
And I can tell the way you do the things you do

As pretty as you are
You know, you could've been a flower
If good looks was a minute
Baby, you could be an hour
The way you stole my heart
You know you could've been a cool crook
And baby, you're so smart
You know you could've been a school book

Well, you could've been anything that you wanted to
And I can tell the way you do the things you do

E   A   E
                    E     A   E
You made my life so rich
                                 E     A    E
You know, you could've been some money
                      E     A    E
And baby, you're so sweet
                                  E      A    E
You know, you could've been some honey

E                  B                       A
Well, you could've been anything that you wanted to
          B   A                              E    A    E
And I can tell the way you do the things you do
