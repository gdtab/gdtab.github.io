Green, Green Grass of Home
Curly Putman

    C                           C7    F                  C
The old home town looks the same as I step down from the train
C                                   G7
And there to meet me is my mama and papa;
Dm7  G7  C               C7             F         Fdim     F         Em7 Dm7
Down the road I look and there runs Mary, hair of gold and lips like cherries,
C                      G7     Dm7   G7       C   F C
it's good to touch the green, green grass of home.

Chorus:
Dm7  G7      C           C7             F
Yes, they'll all come to meet me arms a-reaching, smiling sweetly;
Dm7  C                 G            Dm7   G7 C
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.
    C                           C7          F                    C
The old house is still standing, though the paint is cracked and dry,
C                                            G7
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on;
Dm7  G7  C               C7             F         Fdim     F         Em7 Dm7
Down the lane I look and there runs Mary, hair of gold and lips like cherries,
Dm7  C                 G7           Dm7   G7 C   F  C
it's good to touch the green, green grass of home.

Spoken, same progression

Then I awake and look around me at the four gray walls that surround me and I
realize that I was only dreaming. For there's a guard and there's a sad old
padre. Arm and arm we'll walk at daybreak - again I'll touch the green, green
grass of home

Final Chorus
Dm7  G7      C           C7            F                      Em7
Yes, they'll all come to see me in the shade of that old oak tree;
Dm7     C                 G            Dm7   G7 F Em7 Dm7 C
As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home.
