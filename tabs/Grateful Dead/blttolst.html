There are times that you can beckon
          F                   C
There are times when you must call
        G             Am
You can take a lot of reckoning
    Dm                F
But you can't take it all
          G                C
There are times when I can help you out
    F                   C
And times that you must fall
          G                   Am
There are times when you must live in doubt
    F               G
And I can't help at all

Three blue stars / Rise on the hill
F   C  G                   Dm
Say no more, now / Just be still
F   C     G        C    G  F
All these trials / Soon be past
F    C   G                    Dm
Look for something / Built to last

  G                C
A wind held by the collar
       F                 C
Yes, a cloud held by the breeze
        G                Am
You can walk on coals of fire
    Dm                 F
But sometimes you must freeze
          G                C
There are times when you offend me
      F              C
And I do the same to you
      G                 Am
If we can't or won't forget it,
       F                 G
Then I guess we could be through
F   C    G      C    G      F
One blue star / Sets on the hill

Call it back / You never will

One more star / Sinks in the past

Show me something / Built to last.

F                  C
Built to last till time itself
      G
Falls tumbling from the wall
C                  G
Built to last till sunshine fails
    F
And darkness moves on all
F                   C
Built to last while years roll past
     G                  Am     G
Like cloudscapes in the sky
F                               Em
Show me something built to last
   Dm                      F      G
Or something built to try
Break (Instrumental on verse progression)
          G                  C
There are times when you get hit upon
    F                   C
Try hard but you cannot give
      G                  Am
Other times you'd gladly part
     Dm               F
With what you need to live
      G                    C
Don't waste your breath to save your face
     F                  C
When you have done your best
    G            Am
And even more is asked of you
F                    G
Fate will decide the rest.

F   C   G           C    G   F
All the stars / Are gone but one
F  C    G                       Dm
Morning breaks / Here comes the sun
F     C    G        C  G    F
Cross the sky now / Sinking fast
F    C  G                    Dm     C   Dm  G
Show me something / Built to last.
