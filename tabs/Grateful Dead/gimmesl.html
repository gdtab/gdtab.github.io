Gimme Some Lovin'
Steve and Muff Winwood and Spenser Davis

E7 >>>
Well my temperature is rising got my feet on the floor
Crazy people rocking 'cause they want to go more
Let me in baby I don't know what you got
But you better take it easy 'cause this place is hot

Chorus:
        E7               D  A7           C
And I'm so glad you made it, so glad you made it
         E7          A7      E7                  A7
You gotta gimme some lovin', gimme gimme some lovin'
           E7
every day.

Well I feel so good, everybody's getting high
You better take it easy 'cause the place is on fire
Been a hard day and I don't know what to do
Wait a minute baby, this could happen to you

Chorus

Well I feel so good, everybody's getting high
You better take it easy 'cause the place is on fire
Been a hard day nothing went too good
Now we're gonna relax just like everybody should.

Chorus
