Lyrics Only

I could give up my friend, I know.
And in return, you could give up yours.
If you only think, what would we do later on?
What kind of life would we have, just in case we both were wrong?

I give up my woman, you give your man.
But it don't make sense, to take the chance.
If you only think, what would we do later on?
Just in case we both were wrong?
