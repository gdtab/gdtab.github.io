All I Have To Do Is Dream
D. & P. Everly

     C       Am   Dm7     G7
When I want you    in my arms
     C       Am   Dm             G7
When I want you    and all your charms
    C       Am
Whenever I want you
 F            G7     C   Am   F               G7
All I have to do is dream,  dream,  dream,  dream.

     C        Am   Dm       G7
When I feel blue    in the night
    C      Am   Dm            G7
And I need you    to hold me tight
    C       Am
Whenever I want you
 F            G7      C     F     C     C7
All I have to do is dream

F       Em
I can make you mine   taste your lips of wine
Dm     G7          C     C7
Anytime  night or day
F               Em
Only trouble is   gee whiz
     D7               G7
I'm dreaming my life away

    C      Am  Dm              G7
I need you so    that I could die
    C      Am  Dm             G7
I love you so    and that is why
    C       Am       F            G7      C     F     C
Whenever I want you all I have to do is dream
