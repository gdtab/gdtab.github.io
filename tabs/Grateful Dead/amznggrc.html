Amazing Grace
John Newton

  D                 G         D
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
                     A7
That saved a wretch like me.
   D        D7        G       D
I once was lost, but now am found,
     Bm         A7    D
Was blind, but now I see.

'Twas grace, that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved.
How precious did that grace appear,
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares,
I have already come.
'Tis grace hath brought me safe, thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

When we've been there ten thousand years,
bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise,
Than when we first begun.

Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.

How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
In a believer's ear
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds
And drives away his fear.

Must Jesus bear the cross alone
And all the world go free
No, there's a cross for everyone
And there's a cross for me.
