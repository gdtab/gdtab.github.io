Peggy-O
Traditional
   G          C             G
As we marched out to Fennario
   G  G/F#    Em        Bm
As we marched out to Fennario
    C               G
Our Captain fell in love
       G    G/F#   Em
With a lady like a dove
       G             C                  G
And he called her by name, Pretty Peggy-O

Will you marry me pretty, Peggy-O?
Will you marry me pretty Peggy-O?
If you will marry me, I'll set your cities free,
And free all the ladies in the, are_-O.

I would marry you, sweet, William-O.
I would marry you sweet William-O.
I would marry you but your guineas are too few,
And I fear my mama would be, angry-O.

What would your mama think pretty, Peggy-O?
What would your mama think pretty Peggy-O?
What would your mama think if she heard my guineas clink?
Saw me marching at the head of my, soldiers-O.

Jam
If ever I return pretty, Peggy-O.
If ever I return pretty Peggy-O.
If ever I return your cities I will burn,
And destroy all the ladies in the, are_-O.

Come steppin' down the stairs pretty, Peggy-O.
Come steppin' down the stairs pretty Peggy-O.
Come steppin' down the stairs combin' back your yellow hair.
Bid a last farewell to your, William-O.

Sweet William he is dead pretty, Peggy-O.
Sweet William he is dead pretty Peggy-O.
Sweet William he is dead and he died for a maid.
And he's buried in the Louisiana, country-O.

As we rode out to Fennario, as we rode out to Fennario,
Our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove,

  A      A        A  E  F#mE  D  A
           .  |.                  |
And he called her by name, pretty, Peggy-O.


 Peggy-O
Traditional
This is closest to the Baez version.

C  Am   Em    F   C
As we marched down to Fennario
   C  G    C  G  C    G
As we marched down to Fennario
Am G  C   G   F  C
Our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove
C   Am Em F C
And the name she was called was pretty Peggy-O

The main embellishment I use is on the F chords. In the first and last lines, I hammer on the A note on the G string, i.e. play
e---1------1-----
B---1--------1---
G---0h2--0-----2-
D---3------------
A---3------------
E---1------------

or similar. On "dove" at the end of line 3 I play something like
e------------1---------------1---0--
B----------1---------------1-----1--
G------0h2-----------0-h-2-------0--
D--2-h-3-------2-h-3-------------2--
A--2-h-3-------2-h-3-------------3--
E-----------------------------------

Other verses (again, close to Baez's):

Won't you come and go with me, pretty Peggy-O? (x2)
In coaches you shall ride with your true love by your side
Just as grand as any lady in the are-o

What would your mother think, pretty Peggy-O? (x2)
What would your mother think for to hear the guineas clink
And the soldiers all marching before you?

You're the man that I adore, sweet William-O (x2)
You're the man that I adore, but your fortune is too low
I'm afraid that my mother would be angry-o

Come tripping down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O (x2)
Come tripping down the stairs and tie up your yellow hair
Bid a last farewell to sweet William-O

If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O (x2)
If ever I return then the city I shall burn
And destroy all the ladies in the are-o

Our captain he is dead, pretty Peggy-O (x2)
Our captain he is dead, and he died for a maid
And he's buried in Louisiana county-o.
