Shooting Star
Bob Dylan

INTRO:  E   G#m    A     E
        E   G#m    A
        A   B      E     A
        E   G#m    A     A

         E                    G#m     A            E
I seen a shooting star tonight, and I thought of you,
E                         G#m               A
You're tryin to break into another world, a world I never knew,
              B              E            A
I was kinda wonderin' if you ever made it through, 
         E                    G#m     A            E
I seen a shooting star tonight, and I thought of you.

I seen a shooting star tonight, and I thought of me,
If I was still the same, if I ever became what you wanted me to be
If I missed the mark, over stepped the line, that only you could see
I seen a shooting star tonight, and I thought of me.

C#m                   C#m-9
Listen to the engine, listen to the bell, 
C#m7                      D9
That's the last firetruck from hell, 
A                B                   E
Goes rollin' by, all good people are prayin,
         C#m                  C#m-9
It's the last temptation, the last account,
    C#m7                         D9
The last time you might hear the sermon on the mount,
A                C#m
The last radio's playin.

I seen a shooting star tonight, slip away,
Tomorrow will be another day,
I guess it's too late to say the things to you
         that you needed to hear me say
I seen a shooting star tonight, slip away.
