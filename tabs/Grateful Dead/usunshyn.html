You Are My Sunshine
Jimmy Davis & Charles Mitchell

The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I hung my head and I cried.

Chorus:
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I miss you
Please don't take my sunshine away

I'll always love you and make you happy,
If you will only say the same.
But if you leave me to love another,
You'll regret it all some day:

Chorus

You told me once, dear, you really loved me
And no one else could come between.
But not you've left me and love another;
You have shattered all my dreams:

Chorus
