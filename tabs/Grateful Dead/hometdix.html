A                     F#m
There's fog up on the mountain
         G        D      A
Frost is clingin' to the ground
A                 F#m
Days keep gettin' shorter
              G        D       A
You know, the winter's comin' 'round
F#m                 E
This sure ain't the promised land
D                    E
And I ain't hangin' 'round
A                 F#m
I'm packin' up my traveling bag,
    G        D      A
And checkin' out of town

Put me on that Delta Line,
Little Egypt to the sea
And find me some southern girl
To keep me company
Churnin' down the river
Magnolia on the breeze
And I'll embrace my bayou belle,
Gentle as you please

Been gone too long my honey
        E     D         F#m  E      D
Now I'm goin' home where I   should be

F#m   D   E   D   A

Whistle blow for Vicksburg
Not too far to go
I'm takin' off these northern boots
And settin' free my toes
Gator's on the muddy shore
Smile as if to say
Welcome back to Louisiana, boy
Hope your home to stay

Been gone too long my honey
Now I'm goin' home where I should be

Hey mama, dust my room now,
Plump up the comforter on my bed
Well I say now, slay, the fattest food now
And tell me everything the neighbor said
I'm going to swallow my pride
And pack it up and pack it in
Well, I'm goin' back to that southern pride
and down the bourbon, and give up Gin.
