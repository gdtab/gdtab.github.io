G
When the wind blows,
And the rain feels cold,
With a head full of snow,
With a head full of snow.

In the window,
There's a face you know,
Don't the nights pass slow,
Don't the nights pass slow.

C                          G
Sound of strangers sendin' up into my mind,
C                               G
Just another madman play on the road,
C                        G
I'm am just livin' to be lyin' by your side,
        C            D         C             G              
But I'm just about a moonlight mile down the road.

Need a rag out
On my shiny clothes,
Gonna warm my bones,
Gonna warm my bones.

I got silence,
On my radio,
Let the airwaves flow,
Let the airwaves flow.

I am sleepin' under strange strange skies,
Just another madman day on the road,
My dreams are fleeting down the railway line,
But I'm just about a moonlight mile down the road.

    C                     G
I'm tirin' sister and I'm dreamin'
I'm ridin' down your moonlight mile
I'm hidin' baby and I'm dreamin'
I'm ridin' down your moonlight mile
I'm ridin' down your moonlight mile

C -> G
Let it go now...
Come on look babe
Let it go
Let it flow now baby...
Move on...
Don't you hear...

D
Yeah I've blown it all
          C            D         C             G
Cause I'm just about a moonlight mile down the road.
Down the road, down the road, down the road
Yeah, yeah, yeah baby.
