[Pattern A - Verse]
C               E7
On the day when I was born 
F                  Am
Daddy sat down and cried.
F                      C        G
I had the mark just as plain as day; 
      D7             G7
Which could not be denied.
C                          E7
They say that Cain caught Abel 
F              Am
Rollin' loaded dice;
F                C       G
Ace of Spades behind his ear 
    F                 E7
And him not thinkin' twice.

[Pattern B - Chorus]
Am      (Am/maj7     Am7     D9)
Halfstep, Mississippi uptown toodeloo 
F                C         G
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
F             C        G
Half a cup of Rock and Rye. 
F                   C        G
Farewell to you old Southern skies
    Am        E7
I'm on my way, on my way.

[Verse - A]
If all you got to live for 
Is what you left behind,
Get yourself a powder charge 
And seal that silver mine.
Lost my boots in transit, babe, 
A pile of smokin' leather.
I nailed a retread to my feet 
And prayed for better weather.

[Chorus - B]
[Solo - C]

[Verse - A]
They say that when your ship comes in, 
The first man takes the sails;
The second takes the afterdeck,
The third the planks and rails
What's the point of callin' shots; 
This cue ain't straight in line.
Cue ball's made of styrofoam 
And no one's got the time.

[Chorus - B, hold E7 an extra measure]

[Outro]
 A             D           A              D
Across the Rio Grand-e-o, Across the lazy river.
