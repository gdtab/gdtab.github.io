My Sisters and My Brothers
Robert Johnson

A                                          D
I want to say to my sisters & my brothers, keep the faith.
         A
When the storm flies & the wind blows,
   E
Go on at a steady pace.
         A
When the battle is fought & the victories won.
       D
We can all shout together, we have overcome.
        A                  D
We will talk to the father in the sun,
                                A
When we make it to the promised land.

      A
If we walk together little children.
D
We don't ever have to worry,
A
Through this world of trouble.
             E
We've got to love a-one another.
       A
Let us take our fellow man, by the hand,
D
Try to help him to understand.
       A                   D
We can all be together, forever and ever,
                                A
When we make it to the promised land.

Our bible reads, thou shall not be afraid
Of the terror by night or the arrow that flies by day.
Nor for the pestilence that walketh in the dark,
Nor for the destruction that waiteth in the noonday hour.

This world is not our home, we are only passing through.
Our trail is all made up, way beyond the blue.
Let us do the very best that we can,
While we're travelin' through this land.
We will all be together, shakin' a hand,
When we make it to the promised land.


        A
When we make it to the promised land,
D
Make it to the promised land.
        A
When we make it to the promised land,
E
Make it to the promised land.
        A
When we make it to the promised land,
D
Make it to the promised land.
       A                   D
We can all be together, forever and ever
                                A
When we make it to the promised land.

When we make it to the promised land.
When we make it to the promised land.
