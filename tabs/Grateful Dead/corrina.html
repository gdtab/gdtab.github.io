Hog of a Sunday
D
Dog of a Monday
D
Get it back some day
D
What'd I say?
D
Movin' in closer
D
Cut from a long shot
D
Fade on a down beat
D             
Ready or not
D           
Ready or not

D     G

Corrina

Cruise thru a stop sign
Loggin' up short time
Bird on a phone line
Soakin' up sun
Salt on the crowtail
What can I do?
I'm down by law 
But true to you 

Chorus

* The starred lines are to be played as single notes.  
They're easy to get to to when playing the G chord form.

Em
If, what, when and where
*G          F#     D       B
Told at the proper time
C
Big black wings beat at the wind
    B7         A      Em
But they don't hardly climb
Em
There's a silver ocean
       *G          F#     D     B
Silver clouds on a silver sea
  C
A bird on the horizon
       Em                      G
Silver wingin back to me 
      
Chorus

Shake it up, baby
Shake it down easy
Bring it back someday
What'd I say?
Movin' in closer
Cut from a long shot
Fade on a down beat
Ready or not 

Chorus

If, what, when and where
Don't mean a thing to me
I would love you
Even if you flew away from me
I just stand here waiting
Where the circle is complete
There is no fear that lovers born
Could ever fail to meet

Chorus
