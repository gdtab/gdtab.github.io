Oakie From Muskogee
Merle Haggard

E
We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee;
                              B7
We don't take our trips on LSD
B7
We don't burn our draft cards down on Main Street;
                                 E
We like livin' right, and bein' free.

Chorus:
E
I'm proud to be an Oakie from Muskogee,
                                          B7
A place where even squares can have a ball ----
B7
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse,
                                                 E
And white lightnin's still the biggest thril of all

We don't make a party out of lovin';
We like holdin' hands and pitchin' woo;
We don't let our hair grow long and shaggy,
Like the hippies out in San Francisco do.

Chorus

Leather boots are still in style for mainly footwear;
Beads and roman sandals won't be seen.
Football's still the roughest thing on campus,
And the kids here still respect the college dean.

Chorus

We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse,
In Muskogee, Oklahoma, USA.
