San Francisco Bay Blues
Jesse Fuller

C                                F                        C  C7
I got the Blues for my baby down beside the San Francisco bay,
   F                            C  C7
An ocean-liner took her so far away.
F                             G
I didn't mean to treat her so bad,
            C                     Am
She was the best girl I ever ever had.
F                                          
She said goodbye, she like to make me cry, 
G7
Gonna lay down my head and die.

C                        F                 C   C7
I ain't got a nickel and ain't got a lousy dime.
    F                                         Em7 Em
She don't come back I think I'm gonna lose my mind,
F                     G7         C                          Am
She ever come back to stay, it's gonna be another brand new day.
F                         G                        C  G
Walking with my baby down beside the San Francisco bay.

C                F     C                         F      C C7
I'm sittin' here by my back door, I wonder which way to go.
F                                             C   C7
Woman I'm so crazy about you don't love me anymore,
F                    G7             C                 Am
Think I'll take me a freight train, cause I'm feelin' blue.
F                                       
Ride all the way to the end of the line 
G7
Thinking, sweet baby, of you.

C         F          C                   F    C   C7
Meanwhile in a other city, just about to go insane.
F                              
Thought I heard my sweet baby, 
    G7
The way she used to call my name.
F                        G7    
If she ever come back to stay, 
           C                    Am
It's gonna be another brand new day.
F                         G                        C  Am
Walking with my baby down beside the San Francisco bay.
F                         G                        C  Am
Walking with my baby down beside the San Francisco bay......
