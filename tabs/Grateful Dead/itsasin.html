It's a Sin
Hughes
Lyrics Only

I know it's wrong, the things you do
The way that I mistreated you

Chorus
But I know, oh-oh, it's a sin
It's a sin

My baby told me from the start
She said darling, you're breaking my heart

Chorus

My baby watched me from the side
Then she hung her head and cried

Chorus
