Wild Horses
Jagger/Richards
The Old And In The Way version is done 2 1/2 steps down from this version

Bm        G     
Childhood living    
Bm         G
Is easy to do
Am                  C        D
The things that you wanted, 
G                 D         C
I bought them for you

Graceless lady 
You know who I am
You know I can't let you 
Slide through my hands

Am   C       D  G       F       C    Bm
Wild horses,   couldn't drag me away
Am   C       D  G       F       C
Wild horses,   couldn't drag me away

I watched you suffer 
A dull aching pain
Now you've decided 
To show me the same

No sweeping exits, 
Or off-stage lines
Could make me feel bitter 
Or treat you unkind

Wild horses, couldn't drag me away
Wild horses, couldn't drag me away

I know I dreamed you, 
A sin and a lie
Now, I have my freedom, 
But I don't have much time

Faith has been broken, 
Tears must be cried
Let's do some living 
After we've died

Wild horses, couldn't drag me away
Wild horses, couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses, we'll ride them someday
