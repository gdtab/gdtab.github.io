Am7               Am7                  BoaddE    BoaddE
Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore.
 Am7        Am7                           BoaddE BoaddE
Like the sun, her song is the latch on the morning's door.
 Am7       C(I)
See the sun sparkle in the reeds;
 Am7        C(I)          Bm7     F#m7+5
Silver beads fasten to the seeds.
 F#m7+5               F#m7+5              A(I)   A(I)
She comes from the town where she's known as the woodcutter's daughter,
 A7                       A7                  F#m7+5
She's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water,

 D(I)			   D(I)    Bmin 7
 F#m7+5              F#m7+5  Bm7
She bears it away with the love that the river has taught her.
 A7          A7      C(I)             Esus2
Let it flow, let it flow, wide and clean.
 A7         A7                        BoaddE
'Round and 'round, the cut of the plough and the furrowed field
 A7               A7                          BoaddE
Seasons 'round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal
 A7          C(I)
Broken ground, open and beckoning
 A7          C(I)             Bm7     F#m7+5
To the stream, black dirt live again!
 BoaddE                 F#m7+5             A(I)    A(I)
The ploughman is broad as the back of the land that he's sowing
 A7                 A7                 F#m7+5       F#m7+5
As he dances the circular track of his plough ever knowing
 F#m7+5                    F#m7+5                        Bm7
That the work of his days measures more than just the planting and growing.
 Am7       Am7      BoaddE    Esus2
Let it grow, let it grow, let me heal.

Chorus:
Esus2              B    D(II)  A(II) Em
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
C(II)      G(I)   Bm
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin.
Esus2 B         D(II)    A(II)    Em
Water bright as the sky from which it came
D(II)                   A(II)
Its name is on the earth and takes it in
   G(I)                 D(I)         Em   D(II)
It will not speak but stand inside the rain.

C(II)  G(I)   Bmin    Emin
C(II)  G(I)   Bm      Em
Listen to the thunder shout
Am7   Am7       C(I)
I AM, I AM, I AM

I-I-I
  Esus2
I AM.

Instrumental
follows chords of first verse once through

Am7          Am7         BoaddE     BoaddE
So it goes, we make what we make since the world began,
Am7               Am7                    BoaddE
Nothing more than the love of woman, and the work of man.
Am7         C(I)
Seasons 'round, creatures great and small,
Am7        C(II)           Bm7      F#m7+5
Up and down, as they rise and fall
F#m7+5      C(III)    G(II)    D(III)
Rise and fall.                 		

play twice as long as D(I), then continue the pattern of
the last three chords for a while until...
Am7  Am7  Am7  BoaddE
repeat three measures of Am7, one measure
BoaddE another while until...
{Em7  C#m7+5} x 2            Em7(II)
jam on this for awhile, then
Asus4A(II)  Gsus4G(II) x4
Esus2  Esus2

Chorus

The final jam is just like the first, only it starts from the 
Am7 Am7 Am7 BoaddE
part, ending with a slow fade on the Esus2 chord.

Am                                                    
Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore

Am                                                   Bb7-9/Bdim

See the sun, sparkle in the reeds
Am           C                 Bm  D
Silver beads, pass to the sea

D                                                           A7

                                                 Bm

Am                        C               Em/F# 0 2 2 0 0 2
Let it flow, let it flow, wide and clear 

Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed fields
Season's round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal
Broken ground, open and beckoning
To the spring, black dirt live again

The plowman is broad as the back of the land he is sowing
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his days measures more than planting and growing
Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield

Em/F#         B             G            Em/F#
What shall we say, shall we call it by a name
   C                 G      Bm7
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Em/F# B             G                 Em/F#
Water bright as the sky from which it came
        D                                  A
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
   C                   G                Em/F#
We will not speak, but stand inside the rain
    C      G      D       Em      Am          C     Em/F#
And listen to the thunder shout, "I am, I am, I am, I am"

Jam on verse pattern

So it goes, we make what we made since the world began
Nothing more, the love of the women, work of man
Seasons round, creatures great and small
Up and down, as we rise and fall
