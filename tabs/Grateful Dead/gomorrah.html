Just a song of Gomorrah,   I wonder what they did there
C              G                F         C
Must've been a bad thing to get shot down for

G    Bb  F     F  C     G

I wonder how they blew it up or if they burned it down
Get out, get out Mr. Lot and don't you look around.

Who gave you your orders, someone from the sky
I heard a voice inside my head in the desert wind so dry

Bm
I heard a voice tellin' me to flee 
Em                     G       D
The very same voice I always believe
Bm
Said alot of trouble's comin', 
Am                           D
But it don't have to come to you
C                   G
I'm telling you so you can tell 
              F            C
The rest what you've been through.

But don't you turn around, no, don't look after you
It's not your business how it's done, you're lucky to get through

You're a good upstanding man, a credit to the flock
But if you don't face straight ahead you could not take the shock

Blew the city off the man, left nothing there but fire
The wife of Lot got turned to salt, because she looked behind her.
