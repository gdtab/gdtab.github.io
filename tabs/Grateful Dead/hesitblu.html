Hesitation Blues 
Trad., after J. Kaukonnen

Country Blues tune, in "swung" 4/4, i.e. every quarter is subdivided in 3 (or you can think of it as 12/8, if you'd rather).  When this sort of thing is written down, it is traditionally written as dotted time, but the eighth note is really only 1/3 of a quarter note, not 1/2.  Clear as mud? Count it as ah 1 and ah 2 and ah 3 and ah 4, with all syllables the same length, and you'll do fine.  Quarter notes are at a normal walking speed.

Notes:
1. Low notes, on the beat, are always played by the thumb
2. I use the chord positions marked above the tab to play all the
   other notes--just use the most obvious convenient finger within
   the chord (or nearby) to fret the tabbed notes
3.
/= 1-fret rising slur, //= 2, etc.
^= 1/2 tone push
x= damped note
h= hammer on
!= Broken chord (rapid arpeggio, bass>treble)
==== sustained note

4. The vamp in the first line shows h's before the treble notes in the
   Am and E7 chords: these are hammered on on the beat, but not plucked.

5. There are probably some errors-- if it doesn't sound right, you'll
   know.  It is pretty obvious, once you get the feel.  I never play it
   exactly the same, two verses running, so this is just a template.

I'm not at all sure of the first line of that last verse, but it's
my best guess.  I'd be happy to hear alternate "translations".

Chorus
Said, can I get you now, how long must I hesitate?


Dave Van Ronk version:
 It is in Em, modulating to G to finish up as a blues, and going to B7 at the end to return to Em. Very different from the way Jorma plays it, this is the version I learned first and still like best. Specifically, the chords are: 
|: Em B7| Em B7| Em B7| Em B7/A G7 |C |C7 |G |G7 |D7 |C7 |Em |B7 :|
adding up to 12 fairly easy bars o' blues. The first few bars revolve around a shape in which the barre (1st finger) continues to hold down the first string but is lifted from the 6th (bass E) for the open string. 
I'm not sure how available the Van Ronk version is; anyone needing a copy can email me, I'll send a wav of one verse. The verse is played one time through as the intro.

get you now.............or must I hesi-tate.

Standin' on the corner with a dollar in my hand
Lookin' for a woman who ain't got no man, tell me
How long do I have to wait
Can I get you now, or must I Hesitate.

Eagle on the dollar says in god we trust
Woman wants a man she wants to see a dollar first, tell me
How long do I have to wait
Can I get you now, or must I Hesitate.

If the river was whiskey n' I was a divin' duck
I'd swim to the bottom, lord, and never come up.
How long do I have to wait
Can I get you now, or must I Hesitate.

Nickel is a nickel and a dime is a dime
Houseful of children not one of them mine.
How long do I have to wait
Can I get you now, or must I Hesitate.

Never been to heaven but I've been told
St. Peter taught the angels how to jelly roll.
How long do I have to wait
Can I get you now, or must I Hesitate.


I haven't heard this in years, but performed it regularly for twenty of 
same; neither the arrangement nor the lyrics are quite the same as the 
recording, there's been a "little" mutation with time, and this is a 
simplification of both the original and what I play. Oh, by the way, 
uploaded strictly for educational purposes.
