Back with my wife in Tennessee one day she called to me
Virgil quick come see there goes the "Robert E. Lee"
I don't mind chopping wood, I don't care if the money's no good
Take what you need and leave the rest
But they should never have taken the very best

Like my father before me, I'm a peaceful man
Like my brother before me, I took a rebel stand
Just 18, proud and brave, when a Yankee laid him in his grave
I swear by the blood running below my feet
You can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeat
