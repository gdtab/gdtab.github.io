G
I lit out from Reno, 
      C
I was trailed by twenty hounds
G 
Didn't get to sleep that night 
          C
'Till the morning came around.

D
Set out runnin' but I take my time
  Am
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
   D
If I get home before daylight, 
  Am                  C       D
I just might get some sleep tonight.

Ran into the devil, babe, 
He loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah 
In a cave up in the hills.

Set out runnin' but I take my time, 
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine,
If I get home before daylight, 
I just might get some sleep tonight.

I ran down to the levee 
But the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill 
And vanished in the air.

Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight, 
I just might get some sleep tonight.

D
Got two reasons why I cry 
D
Away each lonely night,
    C
The first one's named Sweet Anne Marie, 
    C                          C  C#
And she's my hearts delight.
    D
The second one is prison, baby, 
    D
The sheriff's on my trail,
    Am
And if he catches up with me, 
     C                D
I'll spend my life in jail.

Got a wife in Chino, babe, 
And one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child, 
But it don't look like me.

Set out runnin' but I take my time,
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine,
If I get home before daylight, 
I just might get some sleep tonight.

Extra Verse

You can borrow from the devil
You can borrow from a friend
The devil'll loan ya twenty
But your friend got only ten

from: 3-20-70b
I ran down to the levee 
The devil caught my scent
Coughed up twenty dollars 
To pay back what was lent
