Betty and Dupree
Traditional

Dupree was a bandit; he was so brave and bol';
He stoled a diamond ring for some of Betty's jelly roll

Betty tol' Dupree, "I want a diamond ring."
Dupree tol' Betty, "I'll give you anything."

"Michigan water taste like cherry wine,
The reason I know: Betty drink it all the time.

"I'm going away to the end of the railroad track
Nothing but sweet Betty can bring me back

Dupree tol' the lawyer, "Clear me if you can
For I have money to back me, sure as I'm a man

The lawyer tol' Dupree, You are a very brave man
But I think you will go to jail and hang"

Dupree tol' the judge, "I am not so brave and bol'
But all I wanted was Betty's jelly roll

The judge tol' Dupree, "Jelly roll's gonna be your ruin
"No, no, judge, for that is what I done quit doing"

The judge tol' Dupree, "I believe you quit too late
Because it is already your fate
