Across the Great Divide
Kate Wolf
A                 D     A
I've been walking in my sleep
         F#m                         D
Counting troubles 'stead of counting sheep
          A                  F#m
Where the years went I can't say
       D             E                A
I just turned around and they've gone away 

A                 D           A
I've been sifting through the layers
         F#m             D
Of dusty books and faded papers
            A               F#m
They tell a story I used to know
                    D        E       A
And it was one that happened so long ago


Chorus:
     A                 D     A
It's gone away in yesterday
             F#m                        D
Now I find myself on the mountainside
                 A      E        F#m   A
Where the rivers change direction
        D         E       A
Across the Great Divide

A                D     A
Now, I heard the owl a-callin'
       F#m              D
Softly as the night was fallin'
       A                F#m
With a question and I replied
         D     E               A
But he's gone across the borderline

Chorus

 A                   D      A
The finest hour that I have seen
       F#m               D
Is the one that comes between
            A                      F#m
The edge of night and the break of day
              D        E       A
It's when the darkness rolls away
