Whining Boy Blues
Jelly Roll Morton
Lyrics Only

Just a whining boy don't deny my name
Just a whining boy don't deny my name, whining boy don't deny my name
Pick it up and shake it, stir the chain
Whining boy don't deny my name

Lookie here, sister, sister, dirty little sow
I said no, sister, sister, dirty little sow
Sister, sister, dirty little sow
Want to be a bad girl, but don't know how

Whining boy don't deny my name
Just a whining boy don't deny my name, deny my name
Whining boy don't deny my name
Pick it up and shake lovie, stir the chain
