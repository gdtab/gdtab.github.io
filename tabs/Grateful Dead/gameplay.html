Games People Play

Oh the games people play now
Every night and every day now
Never meaning what they say now
Never saying what they mean

Oh they whine away the hours
In their ivory towers
Till they're covered up with flowers 
In the back of a black limousine

Chorus
La-din-da .......
I'm talking 'bout you and me 
and the games people play

Oh they make one another cry
Break their hearts and they say goodbye
Cross their hearts and they hope to die
That the other was to blame

Neither one would ever give in
So they gaze at an eight by ten
Thinkin' 'bout the it might have been
And it's a dirty rotten shame

Chorus

Oh they teach you how to meditate
Read your horoscope and teach you faith
And the further more the hell with hate
Come on and get on board

Look around and tell me what you see
What's happening to you and me
God grant me the serenity
To just remember who I am

Chorus
