Tellin' My Friends
?artist?

Here you come again darlin'
You've got that smile on your face
Tell me what's on your mind baby,
Tell me what you've got to say

Well, I'm tellin' my friends all about you
How good you make me feel inside
Well if there's a chance I'm gonna be with you
I sure want to have a good time

Well, I'm tellin' my friends all about you.... 

My love for you is so strong,
I think about you all night long
Every time I get next to you baby,
My body shakes all night long
All night long, baby.....

It don't matter where I may be
My love just might come down
Whose ever gonna be with me baby,
I'll have to just tell 'em how fine you are.

Well, I'm tellin' my friends all about you....
