When First Unto This Country
Traditional, 
Arr. J. Garcia & D. Grisman
     E               B
When first unto this country
  A          E
A stranger I came
  A         B    E
I courted a fair maid
    A             E
And Nancy was her name.

I courted her for love
Her love I didn't obtain
Do you think I've any reason
Or right to complain.

I rode to see my Nancy
I rode both night and day
I stoled a fine stallion
From Colonel Charles Grey.

I rode to see my Nancy
I rode both day and night
I courted fairest Nancy
My own heart's true delight.

The sheriff's men they followed
And overtaken me
They carted me away
To the penitentiary.

They opened up the door
And then they threw me in
They shaved off my hair
And they cleared off my chin.

They beat me and they banged me,
And they fed me on dry beans
'Til I wished to my own soul
I'd never been a thief.

With my hands stuck in my pockets
And my cap set on so bold
My coat of many colors
Like Joseph's of old.

When first unto this country
A stranger I came
I courted a fair maid
And Nancy was her name.
