Gentlemen, Start Your Engines
Mydland / Barlow
Lyrics Only

It's three AM in the combat zone.
Gentlemen start your engines!
They can close this bar, but baby I ain't goin.
Gentlemen start your engines!

If you lock up the whiskey, give me gasoline.
I got a seven grand redline on the black machine.
The dead can do my sleepin', if you know what I mean.
Gentlemen start your engines!

Ge-Ge-Ge-Gentlemen start your engines!
Gentlemen start
Gentlemen start
Ge-Ge-Ge-Gentlemen start your engines!

Got a little girl here in a pinafore dress.
Gentlemen start your engines!
She's got more tricks than you can guess.
Gentlemen start your engines!

It's dark outside, but it's darker within.
Check the back of my jacket just to see my grin.
They don't write pomes about the state I'm in.
Gentlemen start your engines!

Ge-Ge-Ge-Gentlemen start your engines!
Gentlemen start
Gentlemen start
Ge-Ge-Ge-Gentlemen start your engines!

One of these days I'm gonna pull myself togeather.
Soon as I finish tearin' myself apart
Like the Devil's Mustangs,
I've been ridin' hell for leather,
Put away wet and angry in the dark.

When the police come you better let 'em in,
Gentlemen start your engines!
Don't forget to tell 'em what a sport I've been.
Gentlemen start your engines!

I got a head full of vintage TNT,
They're gonna blow me up 'stead of burying me.
If you're lookin' for trouble come and sit with me.
Gentlemen start your engines!

Ge-Ge-Ge-Gentlemen start your engines!
Gentlemen start
Gentlemen start
Ge-Ge-Ge-Gentlemen start your engines!

One of these days I'm gonna pull myself togeather.
Soon as I finish tearin' myself apart
Let me tell you, honey,
There's some mighty stormy weather
Howlin' round the caverns of my heart.
