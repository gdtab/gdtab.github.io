Wave to the Wind
Hunter / Lesh
Lyrics Only

 Gonna wave to the people
looking on the side of
the road as I'm rolling by
Wave goodbye to trouble
that's always on my mind
Gonna jumpstart my life
or go down trying

Gonna wave to the mem'ries
I carry in my heart and the
new ones I'll find along my way;
to the new millenium
reeling 'round the bend like
a dove or a dark-wing bird of prey

Gonna wave, gonna wave
Gonna wave to the wind
Gonna wave my way
my way on through the wind
Gonna wave, Gonna wave
Gonna wave to the wind
Gonna wave my way to the
edge of the world and jump in

Gonna snap like a banner
sailing sheets to the breeze over
oceans of sky to the moon
I could hold out forever
keeping it together
or wish upon a star and call the tune

Lift my voice like the young man
broken in the war who
cries out to know the reason why
Gonna rise up and reel out
the love song in my soul to the
high wide and handsome morning sky

Gonna wave, gonna wave
Gonna wave to the wind
Gonna wave my way
my way on through the wind
Gonna wave, Gonna wave
Gonna wave while the wind
plays the stars, the sky, the
moon and the night like a hymn

Gonna ride with the thunder
let the sky crack asunder
as lightning cries out the rain
Gonna wade across rivers
gathered in the streams from the
mountains that rise above the plain

Wave away my confusion
that drives this delusion
so long I forgot that I could fly
Soar aloft like a songbird
dancing in the wind,
singing long, singing loud, singing high

Gonna speak to the breeze,
add my voice to the wind
singing: say, can you see me
by the dawn's early light screaming in?
