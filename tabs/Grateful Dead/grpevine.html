repeat 40000's times

that's basically it. there's two guitars in the song. the first plays that
part and the other plays a reptiotion of the following chords:

Dm     A7   G.    then the end of the verse comes in, and i guess you can
throw in a Bm. here are the verses:-)

Verse 1:

Bet you're wondering how i knew 'bout your plans to make me blue, with some
other guy that you knew before. between the two of us guys you knew i love
you more. it took me by surprise i must say when i found yesterday 

Ooh I

Chorus:

yeah:

Verse 2:

you know that a man ain't supposed to cry, but these tears i can't hold
inside. losin you would end my like you see, cause you mean that much to me.
you could have told me yourself that you found someone else. instead I

Chorus:

Verse 3:

people say believe half of what you see, son, and none of what you hear. I
can't help being confused if it's true please tell me dear? do u plan to let
me go for the others guy that you knew before. 

Oooh I

Chrous:

p.s.   if there are 2 guitar players around, one person play the crap at the
top, and another play the samething, but just improvise.
3rd String-5th string
4th String-6th string,
meaning, the other person play a nice bassy part, just following the same
shit at the top, but using 3rd string as the 5th string.
