After The Gold Rush
Neil Young

D      G

        D                            G
Well, I dreamed I saw the knights in armor coming
       D                 G
Sayin' something about a queen
           D                    A        
There were peasants singin' and drummers drumming
        G                A
And the archer split the tree
            Bm              C
There was a fanfare blowin' to the sun
     Bm             C
That floated on the breeze
D                     A                 C             G
Look at Mother Nature on the run in the nineteen seventies
D                     A                 C             G
Look at Mother Nature on the run in the nineteen seventies

I was lyin' in a burned out basement
With a full moon in my eyes
I was hopin' for a replacement
When the sun burst through the skies
There was a band playin' in my head
And I felt like getting high
Thinkin' about what a friend had said, 
I was hopin' it was a lie
Thinkin' about what a friend had said, 
I was hopin' it was a lie

Well, I dreamed a saw the silver spaceships flying
In the yellow have of the sun
The were children crying and colors flying 
All around the chosen ones
All in a dream, all in a dream
The loading had begun
Flyin' mother nature's silver seed
To a new home in the sun
Flyin' mother nature's silver seed
To a new home
