Go on home your mama's calling you.

Kalico, Kahlia, come tell me the news.
Calamity's waiting for a way to get to her.
Rosy red and electric blue 
I bought you a paddle for your paper canoe.

It all depends on what's with you.

Hung up waiting for a windy day 
Kite on ice since the first of February.
Mama keeps saying that the wind might blow ,
But standing here I say I just don't know.

New ones comin' as the old ones go,
Everything's moving here but much too slowly,
A little bit quicker and we might have time,
To say "How do you do?" before we're left behind.

The very last lately inquired about you,
     D           A      D
It's really very one or two. 
    E         B           D      A
The first you wanted, the last I knew.

I just wonder if you shouldn't feel,
Less concerned about the deep unreal,
The very first word is "How do you do?",
The last "Go home your mama's callin' you."

        A      G   D    A
Calling you,
