Early one morning the sun was shinin' I was layin' in bed.
A                  G                     D
Wondering if she'd changed at all if her hair was still red.
A                            G               A                 G
Her folks they said that our lives together, sure was gonna be rough.
     A                     G                       D
They never did like Mama's home-made dress, Papa's bank book wasn't big enough.
    E                     F#m               A                  D
And I was standing on the side of the road, rain fallin' on my shoes.
E                            F#m         A                    D
Heading out for the old east coast, Lord knows I've paid some dues,

Tangled up in blue.

She was married when we first met, soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam I guess, but I used a little too much force
We drove that car as far as we could, abandoned it out West
Split up on a sad dark night, both agreeing it was best
She turned around to look at me, as I was walking away
I heard her say over her shoulder, "We'll meet again someday,
on the avenue"
Tangled up in Blue.

I had a job in the great north woods working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much and one day the axe just fell
So I drifted down to New Orleans where I was lucky to be employed
Workin' for a while on a fishing boat right outside of Delacroix
But all the while I was alone the past was close behind
I seen alot of women but she never escaped my mind
and I just grew
Tangled up in blue.

She was working in topless place and I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear
And later on when the crowd thinned out I was just about to do the same
She was standing there in back of my chair said to me Don't I know your name
I muttered something underneath my breath she studied the lines on my face
I must admit I felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces 
of my shoe
Tangled up in blue

She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe
I thought you'd never say hello she said "You look like the silent type"
Then she open up a book of poems and handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet from the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal
Pourin' off of every page like it was written in my soul 
from me to you
Tangled up in blue

He was always in a hurry, too busy or too stoned
And everything she ever planned just had to be postponed
He thought they were successful, she thought they were blessed
With objects and material things but I never was impressed
And when it all came crashing down, I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on 
like a bird that flew
Tangled up in Blue

I lived with them on Montague Street in a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air
Then he started dealing in slaves and something inside of died
She had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside.
And when the bottom finally feel out I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on 
like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue

So now I'm going on back again I got to get to her some how
All the people we used to know they're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians some are carpenters wives
Don't know how it all got started I 
				don't know what they're doing with their lives
But me, I'm still on the road headin' for another joint
We always did feel the same we just saw it from a different point
Of view
Tangled up in Blue.
 Tangled Up In Blue
Alternate Lyrics, Bob Dylan
The chords and lyrics posted before are right.  But Dylan's genious
really comes through in his live versions of this song, when he
completely changed the lyrics.  These are the lyrics to the version on
the "Real Live" album:

Early one morning, the sun was shining, he was laying in bed.
wondering if she changed at all, if her hair was still red.
Her folks they said that thier lives together sure was gonna be rough.
They never did like mama's homemade dress, Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
And he was standing on the side of the road rain falling on his shoes,
heading out for the lone east coast, radio blasting the news
straight on through
Tangled up in blue.

She was married when they first met, to a man 4 times her age.
He left her penniless, in a state of regret, 
					it was time to break out of the cage.
They drove that car as far as they could, abandoned it out west.
splitting up on a dark, sad night, both agreeing that it was best.
And she turned around to look at him as he was walking away.
She said "I wish I could tell you all the things that I never learned how to say."
He said thats alright babe "I love you too",
but we were Tangled up in Blue.

He had a steady job and a pretty face, and everything seemed to fit.
One day he could just feel the waste, he put it all down and split.
And he headed down to New Orleans, where they treated him like a boy.
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge, he nearly drowned in Delacroix(sp).
And all the time he was alone, the past was close behind.
he had one too many lovers then, and none of them were too refined,
all except for you,
but you were tangled up in blue.

She was working in the blinding light, and I stopped in for a drink.
I just kept looking at her face so white, I didn't know what to think.
Later on as the crowd thinned out, I was getting ready to leave.
She was standing there, beside my chair, 
					saying "What's that you got up your sleeve?"
I said "nothing baby, and thats for sure" She leaned down into my face.
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces 
of my shoe,
Tangled up in Blue.

 I lived with him on Montague street in a basement down the stairs.
There was snow all winter and no heat, revolution was in the air.
Then one day all his slaves ran free, something inside of him died.
The only thing I could do was be me, and get on that train and ride.
And it all came crashing down, I was already south.
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round, 
						I had the worst taste in my mouth,
that I ever knew,
Tangled up in Blue.

Now I'm going back again, maybe tommorow, maybe next year.
I've got to find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear.
Some are ministers of illusion, some are masters of the trade.
All under strong delusion, all of thier beds are unmade.
Me I'm heading toward the sun, trying to stay out of the joint.
We always did love the very same one.  We just saw her from a different point
of view,
Tangled up in Blue.
