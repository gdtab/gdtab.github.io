Nothin' shakin' on Shakedown Street; 
C7sus4                  C7    C7sus4   C7
used to be the heart of town.
      C7sus4                  C7            C7sus4   C7
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart.
    C7sus4           C7      C7sus4  C7   C#7
You just gotta poke around.

You think you've seen this town clear through.
Well, well, well, you can never tell.
Nothin' here that could int'rest you.
Well, well, well, you can never tell.
It's not because you missed out 
On the things that we had to start.
Maybe you had too much too fast 
(maybe you had too much too fast).
Maybe you had too much too fast 
(maybe you had too much too fast).
Maybe you had too much too fast 
(maybe you had too much too fast).
Or just overplayed your part.

Jam on verse, bridge, & chorus chords

Since I'm passin' your way today,
Well, well, well, you can never tell.
I just stopped by 'cause I want to say:
Well, well, well, you can never tell.
I recall your darkness when it 
Cracked like a thunder cloud.
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart 
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart 
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart 
(Don't tell me this town ain't got no heart)
When I can hear it beat out loud.
