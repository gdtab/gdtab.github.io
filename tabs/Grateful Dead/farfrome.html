You say you want to try again
               D
Better read it down between the lines
               A
Well, I have a better end in mind.

You are so far from me.

There was something I had caught inside
Screamin' hard to make it known
Oh, in time it died alone
It doesn't seem you really have to
Close your eyes to see
You have been all you'll be to me

And we can't relate at all.

It doesn't seem you really have to
Close your eyes to see
Though I know you don't mean to be
You are so far from me.

G               A                          D            G
This time's the last time I want to say so long(So Long,ooh)

This song's my last song for you
G                    A                   D              G
There's just nothing here to hold on to again  (Hold On To)
G               A                       D
Nothing to hold on to.
