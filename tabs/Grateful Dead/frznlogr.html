The Frozen Logger
James Stevens
Lyrics Only

As I sat down one evening within a small cafe,
A forty-year-old waitress to me these words did say:

I see that you are a logger and not just a common bum,
'Cause nobody but a logger stirs his coffee with his thumb.

My lover was a logger, there's none like him today;
If you'd pour whiskey on it he could eat a bale of hay.

He never shaved his whiskers from off of his horny hide;
He'd just drive them in with a hammer and bite them off inside.

My lover came to see me upon one freezing day;
He held me in a fond embrace which broke three vertebrae.

He kissed me when we parted, so hard that he broke my jaw;
I could not speak to tell him he'd forgot his mackinaw.

I saw my lover leaving, sauntering through the snow,
Going gaily homeward at forty-eight below.

The weather it tried to freeze him, it tried its level best;
At a hundred degrees below zero he buttoned up his vest.

It froze clean through to China, it froze to the stars above;
At a thousand degrees below zero it froze my logger love.

And so I lost my lover, and to this cafe I come,
And here I wait till someone stirs his coffee with his thumb.
