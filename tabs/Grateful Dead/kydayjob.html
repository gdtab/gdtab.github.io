'Till your night job pays.

Steady boys starting that eight day hour
Never underrate that paycheck power
By now you know that the face on your dollar
Got a thumb on its nose and a hand on your collar
Which is to say, hey, hey, hey

Chorus

Daddy may drive a Sting-Ray 'Vette
Mama may bathe in champagne yet
God bless the child that's got his own stash
Nine to five and a place to crash
Which is to say, hey, hey, hey

Chorus

Sunday comes forget about work, 
Ring that bell for whatever it's worth.
If you ask me, which I know you don't,
I'd tell you to do what I know you won't
Which is to say, hey, hey, hey

Additional Verse/Chorus
Ring that bell for whatever it's worth
When Monday comes don't forget about work
By now you know that the face on your dollar
Got a thumb on its nose and a hand on your collar
With a chance to say, hey hey

Chorus
Punch that time card; Check that clock
When Monday comes; You gotta run, run, run
Not walk
