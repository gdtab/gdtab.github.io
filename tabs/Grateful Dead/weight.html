I picked up my bags, I went lookin' for a place to hide.
When I saw Carmen & the Devil, walkin' side-by-side.
I said, "Hey, Carmen, c'mon let's go downtown."
She said, "I gotta go, but my friend can stick around."

Chorus
Lay down Miss Moses, there's nothing you can say.
It's just old Luke, & Luke's waiting on the judgement day.
"Well Luke my friend, what about young Annalee?"
He said, "Do me a favor, son, won't you stay & keep Annalee company?"

Chorus
Crazy Chester come to me, just a looking for the door.
He said, "I'll fix ya right, if you take Jack my dog."
I said, "Wait a minute Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man."
He said, "Okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can?"

Chorus
Lord getcha cannonball, now to take me down the line.
My bag is sinkin' low, and I do believe it's time
To get back to Miss Fannie, you know she's the only one
Who sent me here with her, regards for everyone.

Chorus
