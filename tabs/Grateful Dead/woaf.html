|Am                     |F            
   Watchin' girls go passing by       
|G                         |C
  It ain't the latest thing
|G            |            |C           |
I'm just standin' in a doorway
|G            |                   |C          |
I'm just trying to make some sense

|Am                           |F      
Out of these girls        passing by, 
|G                    |C
the tales they tell of men
|G          |         |C          |
I'm not waiting on a lady                    
|G          |               |C       |  
I'm just waiting on a friend

A smile relieves a heart that grieves, remember what I said.
I'm not waiting on a lady, I'm just waiting on a friend.

Bridge:     |C        |F                  |C
... on a friend       I'm just waiting on a friend
|F                 |C               |F                  |C
 just waiting on a friend.        I'm just waiting on a friend,
    |F                |C        |F                 |C    
I'm just waiting on a friend,     just waiting on a friend

Instrumental 16 bars, alternating F and C

Don't need a whore, don't need no booze, don't need no virgin priest
But I need some one I can cry to, I need someone to protect.

Ooh, making love and breaking hearts, it is a game for youth.
But I'm not waiting on a lady, I'm just waiting on a friend.

Repeat bridge, fade instrumental
