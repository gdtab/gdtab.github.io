Touch Of Grey
Garcia/Hunter
Intro:
E   A  E   B F# B F#   A  E  A  E  B  F#  B  F#

B               F#  B E                   A   E
Must be getting early, clocks are running late,
F#                                    B    E
Paint-by-number morning sky, looks so phony.
B                F#   B      E               A        E
Dawn is breaking everywhere, light a candle, curse the glare,
F#                         B            E
Draw the curtains, I don't care, 'cause it's alright.

F# B        E
I  will get by,

F# B        E
I  will get by,
F# B        A E F#
I  will bet by,
          E     A E   B F# B F#
I will survive.

I see you've got your fist out, say your piece and get out,
Yes I get the gist of it, but it's all right.
Sorry that you feel that way, the only thing I meant to say,
Every silver lining's got a touch of grey.

Chorus

C#m    C#        F# B F#
It's a lesson to me, 
    C#m           C#             F#   B  F#
The Ables and the Bakers and the C's
G#m   D#m C#            F#   B      E             F#
The ABCs   we all must face, try to keep a little grace.

It's a lesson to me, the Deltas in the East and the Freeze
The ABCs, we all think of, try to give a little love

I know the rent is in arrears, the dog has not been fed in years,
It's even worse than it appears, but it's all right.
The cow is giving kerosene, kid can't read at seventeen,
The words he knows are all obscene, but it's all right.

Chorus

The shoe is on the hand it fits, there's really nothing much to it
Whistle through your teeth and spit, 'cause, it's all right.
Oh, well, a Touch of Grey, kind of suits you anyway
That was all I had to say, it's all right.

I will get by, I will get by
I will get by, I will survive
We will get by, we will get by
We will get by, we will survive
