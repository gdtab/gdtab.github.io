Train I ride, sixteen coaches long.  :||x2
The woman I  love,    she's on that train and gone.

Train, train, rollin' down the track. {x2}
It took away my baby, and it's never comin' back.

Train train, rolling 'round the bend. {x2}
It took away my baby, I'll never see her again.

Train train, rolling 'round the curve. {x2}
It took away my baby, guess I got what I deserve.

Well I went down to the station, to meet my baby at the gate
Asked the station master, "Is your train running late?"
She said she'd be waiting on the 4:44
muted E chord, crescendo to full chord
Well, I hate to tell you boy, that train don't stop here any more.

Well I went down to the station, to meet my baby at the gate
Asked the station master, "Is your train running late?"
Heard that whistle blow across the middle of the night
When I got down to the station the train was way out of sight.

I went across the river and I lay down to sleep
When I woke up, had shackles on my feet.
Twenty nine links of chain around my leg
The other end of the chain was locked to my baby's bed.

I asked that judge, tell me, what's gonna be my fine
Twenty one years on the R.C. Mountain line.
Twenty one years to pay for my awful crime
Twenty one years, but I still got ninety-nine.

I looked down the track, as far as I could see
A little bitty hand, was waving back at me.
Thought I'd done her right, thought I'd paid my dues
'Nother man had my woman, and I had the blues.

I ain't the doctor, I'm the doctor's son
But I can do the doctorin' 'til the doctor's done.
Where does it hurt baby, where is your pain
I'll make you forget it babe, we'll take a walk out in the rain.

I was born in England, was raised in France
Bought a suit of clothes, but they wouldn't send the pants.
Moved to Alabama, then to Tennessee
If you don't like my peaches, then don't shake my tree.

She throwed my hat out the window, my clothes out the door
I'll get another mama, I don't want her anymore.
Spent my money - to the last long dime
She's a-cussin' and a-fussin' and a-fightin' all the time.

They put me in jail, with my back to the wall
Along comes the mama, the cause of it all.
I'll sleep in the woods, in a hollow log,
'Fore I'll stay with you, let you treat me like a dog.

Come here mama, pin a rose on me
There's a sweet little woman I'm goin' off to see.
A hesitatin' papa with the hesitation blues
Found a hesitatin' woman that he can't afford to lose.

Train train, chuggin' on up that grade. {x2}
It took away my baby, but my love it'll never fade.
