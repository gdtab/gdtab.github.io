Lonely Avenue
Pompus
Cm
Well, my room has got two windows
    Cm
The sunlight never comes through
Cm
I'm so sad and lonely, baby
        Cm
Since I broke off stayin' with you
            Fm
I live on a Lonely Avenue
Fm
Girl, since you said you do
      Cm
And I feel so sad and blue
         Cm
And it's all because of you
        G
I could die, I could die, I could die, 
        Fm
I could die, I could die, I could die, 
            Cm
I live on a Lonely Avenue

My covers feel like lead
And my pillow is made of stone
I toss and turn every night
I'm not used to livin' alone

I live on a Lonely Avenue
Girl, since you said you do
And I feel so sad and blue
And it's all because of you
I could cry, I could cry, I could cry, 
I could cry, I could cry, I could cry, 
I live on a Lonely Avenue
