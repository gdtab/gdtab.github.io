A rifle on my shoulder, six shooter in my hand.

Oh Lord, I been all around this world.

Lulu, my Lulu, come and open the door.
Lulu, my Lulu, come and open the door.
Before I have to walk in with my old .44
Oh, Lord, I been all around this world.

Mama and papa, little sister makes three.
Mama and papa, little sister makes three.
They're comin in the mornin, thats the last you'll see of me
Oh, Lord, I been all around this world.

Hang me, oh, hang me, so I'll be dead and gone.
Hang me, oh, hang me, so I'll be dead and gone.
I wouldn't mind your hangin boys, but I wait in jail so long
Oh, Lord, I been all around this world.
