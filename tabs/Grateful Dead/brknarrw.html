Do you feel what I feel ?

Can we make it so it's part of the deal?
C       D                 G       D
I gotta hold you in these arms of steel.
C                     D              Dsus4
Lay your heart on the line......this time.

I wanna breathe when you breathe,
When you whisper like that hot summer breeze.
Count the beads of sweat that cover me.
Didn't you show me a sign, this time?

Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow?
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain?
There he goes, moving across the water.
There he goes, turning my whole world around.

Can you see what I see?
Can you cut behind the mystery?
I will meet you by the witness tree
Leave the whole world behind.

I want to come when you call,
I'll get to you if I have to crawl.
They can't hold me with these iron walls,
We've got mountains to climb.

Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain?
There he goes, moving across the water.
There he goes turning my whole world around.
