E                       D
Please allow me to introduce myself
      A                 E
I'm a man of wealth and taste
E                      D
I've been around for a long, long years
      A                     E
Stole many a man's soul and faith

I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt in Faith
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

B                                        E
Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name
              B                                E
'Cause what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game

I stuck around St. Petersburg 
When I saw it was a time for a change
I killed the Czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain

I rode a tank 
At the General's rank
When the Blitzkreig raged 
And the bodies stank

Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name
'Cause what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game

I watched with glee 
While your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades
For the God's they made

I shouted out
Who killed the Kennedys?
When after all,
It was you and me

Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I laid traps for Troubadours 
Who get killed before they reach Bombay

Pleased to meet you, hope you guessed my name
'Cause what's puzzlin' you is the nature of my game
