Three Little Birds
Bob Marley

Chorus
G
Singin' don't worry   about a thing,
             C                          G
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright
G
Singin' don't worry   about a thing,
             C                          G
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright

             G
Rise up this morning,
                D
Smiled with the rising sun
             G               C
Three Little Birds sit by my doorstep
        G
Singin' sweet songs
             D
And melodies pure and true
        C
Sayin' "This is my message to you"

             G
Rise up this morning,
                D
Smiled with the rising sun
             G               C
Three Little Birds sit by my doorstep
        G
Singin' sweet songs
             D
And melodies pure and true
        C
Sayin' "This is my message to you"

G
Singin' don't worry   about a thing,
             C                          G
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright
