Simple Twist Of Fate
Bob Dylan
Intro:
Verse pattern x1

E               
They sat together in the park 
Emaj7
As the evening sky grew dark
E7
She looked at him and he felt a spark 
A
Tingle to his bones
     Am
Twas then he felt alone 
    E           B         A
And wished that he'd gone straight
    E                 A      B        E
And watched out for a simple twist of fate

They walked along by the old canal 
A little confused, I remember well
And stopped into a strange hotel 
With a neon burnin' bright
He felt the heat of the night 
It hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate

A saxophone someplace far off played 
As she was walkin' by the arcade
As the light bust through a beat-up shade 
Where he was wakin' up
She dropped a coin into the cup 
Of the blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate

He woke up, the room was bare, 
He didn't see her anywhere
He told himself he didn't care, 
Pushed the window open wide
Felt an emptiness inside 
To which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate

He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks 
Where the sailors all come in
Maybe she'll pick him out again, 
How long must he wait
One more time, for a simple twist of fate

People tell me it's a sin 
To know and feel too much within
I still believe she was my twin, 
But I lost the ring
She was born in spring, 
But I was born too late
Blame it on a simple twist of fate
