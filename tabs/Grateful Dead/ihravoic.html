I Hear A Voice Callin'
Traditional
Lyrics Only

I hear a voice calling it must be our Lord (must be, must be our Lord)
It's coming from heaven on high
I hear a voice calling I hear the reward (I hear the reward)
In the land where we never shall die

Jesus will die on cold calvary
He's shed his last blood that the world might be free
So follow his footsteps up and down the way
And be ready to meet him when he comes on that day

Repeat twice

I hear a voice calling it must be our Lord (must be, must be our Lord)
It's coming from heaven on high
I hear a voice calling I hear the reward (I hear the reward)
In the land where we never shall die
