Poison Ivy 
Lieber and Stoller

G  GFG  G  GFG

G                     GFG
She comes on like a rose
G                 GFG
but everybody knows
G                  GFG
she'll get you in Dutch
         G
you can look but you'd better not touch

Chorus:
       Em           Bm
Poison Ivy   Poison Ivy
        Em 
Late at night while you're sleeping
Bb                        Em    D
Poison Ivy comes creeping around

She's pretty as a daisy
but look out man she's crazy
she'll really do you in
if you let her get under your skin

Bridge:
C
Measles make you mumpy and mumps will make you lumpy
G
and chicken pox will make you jump and switch
C
A common cold will fool you and whooping cough can cool ya
       D
But Poison Ivy lord will make you itch

Your gonna need an ocean
of calamine lotion
You'll be scratching like a hound
the minute you start to mess around

Chorus - Bridge - Last Verse - Chorus 

La la la la
la la la la
la la la la
