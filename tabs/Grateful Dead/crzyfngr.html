Gsus4   G   

D         C                G
Your rain falls like crazy fingers
Bb               F      Fm            Gsus4   G
Peals of fragile thunder keeping time
Bb         Bbm       Ebmaj7       Cm    G    Gsus4  G
Recall the days that still are to come. Some sing   blue.

Hang your heart on laughing willow 
Stray down to the water, deep sea of love
Beneath the cool calm face of the sea swift undertow.

Fm                      Ab            Eb
Life may be sweeter for this, I don't know,
Fm          Ab          Eb       Cm/G   G7
See how it feels in the end.
Ab       Ao7          Ebmaj7   
May Lady Lullaby sing plainly for you 
Dmaj7 Dbmaj7  Db7   Dbmaj7  Gsus4    G
Soft, strong, sweet and     true.

Cloud hands reaching from a rainbow 
Tapping at the window, touch your hair
So swift and bright strange figures of light float in air.

Who can stop what must arrive now? 
Something new is waiting to be born
Dark as the night you're still by my side shine inside .

Gone are the days we stopped to decide 
Where we should go, we just ride.
Gone are the broken eyes we saw through in dreams 
Gone, both dream and lie.

Life may be sweeter for this, I don't know,
Feels like it might be all right,
While Lady Lullaby sings plainly through you 
Love still rings true.

Midnight on a carousel ride
Reaching for the gold ring down inside
Never could reach it, just slips away but I try.
