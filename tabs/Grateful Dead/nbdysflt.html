Nobody's Fault But Mine
Traditional
Lyrics Only

Nobody's fault but mine if I don't read my soul gets lost
Nobody's fault but mine
Had a Bible in my hand, had a Bible in my arm

My mother she taught me how to read
My mother she taught me how to read
If I don't read my soul gets lost
Nobody's fault but mine, nobody's fault but mine
