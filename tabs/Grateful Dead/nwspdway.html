E
Please don't dominate the rap Jack, 
E
If you got nothin' new to say.
E
If you please, don't back up the tracks, 
E
This train's got to run today.

                             E7
I spent a little time on the mountain, 
E
Spent a little time on the hill.  
E
I heard some say, better run away; 
  G        D            A    
Others say better stand still.

    E              
Now I don't know but I been told that 
     G       D            A
It's hard to run with the weight of gold
E                       
Other hand, I've heard it said, 
     G         D           A
It's just as hard with the weight of lead

Who can deny, who can deny, 
It's not just a change of style.
One step done and another begun, 
And I wonder how many miles.

I spent a little time on the mountain, 
Spent a little time on the hill,
I saw things getting out of hand 
I guess they always will.

Well, I don't know, but I've been told 
In the heat of the sun a man died of cold				
Keep on comin' or stand and wait 
With the sun so dark and the hour so late.

You can't overlook the lack, Jack, 
Of any other highway to ride,
It's got no signs or dividing lines, 
And very few rules to guide.

Now I don't know but I've been told 
If the horse don't pull you got to carry the load.		
I don't know whose back's that strong; 
Maybe find out before too long.

E                   
One way or another, one way or another, 
E              
One way or another, this darkness has got to give.
