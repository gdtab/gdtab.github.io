No, no! She can't take your mind and leave
            G    D       C           Em         A
I know it's just another trick she's got up her sleeve
          G          D          C     Em     A
I can't believe that she really wants you to die
               G          D     C      Em       A
After all it's more than enough to pay for your lie

Wait a minute, watch what you're doin' with your time
E                     D                C      A    G D C Em
All the endless ruins of the past must stay behind, 
A
Yeah

Well, can't you see that you're killing each other's soul
Well, you're both out in the streets and you got no place to go
Your constant battes are getting to be a bore
So go somewhere else and continue your cream puff war
