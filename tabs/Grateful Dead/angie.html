Angie
Jagger/Richards
Am     E7
Angie, Angie
G               Bb     F          F   Em  Dm  C
When will those clouds all disappear?
Am     E7
Angie, Angie
G             Bb   F        F    Em  Dm  C
Where will it lead us from here?
        G                          Dm           Am
With no lovin' in our souls and no money in our coats
C         F              G
You can't say we're satisfied
    Am     E7
But Angie, Angie
G         Bb  F          F    Em  Dm  C
You can't say we never tried

Angie, you're beautiful, yeah
But ain't it time we said good-bye
Angie, I still love ya, 
Remember all those nights of cryin'
All the dreams we held so close seemed to all go up in smoke
Let me whisper in your ear
Angie, Angie
Where will it lead us from here?

With no lovin' in our souls and no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied
But Angie, Angie
You can't say we never tried

    G                               Dm                Am
Oh, Angie, don't you weep, all your kisses they taste sweet
C           F               G
I hate that sadness in your eyes
    Am     E7
But Angie, Angie
G        Bb   F           F   Em  Dm  C
Ain't it time we said goodbye?

With no lovin' in our souls and no money in our coats
You can't say we're satisfied

    Dm                      Am
But Angie, I still love ya, baby,
Dm                            Am
Everywhere I look, I see your eyes
Dm                             Am
There ain't a woman that comes close to you
C       F              G
Come on baby, dry your eyes

Angie, Angie
Ain't it good to be alive?
But Angie, Angie
You can't say we never tried
