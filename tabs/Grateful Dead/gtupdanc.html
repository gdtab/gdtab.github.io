Get Up and Dance
?artist?

Such a lovely night ... for dancin'
And I get this feelin' full of song
Love sunset's so right
And I feel like the music really turns me on
Love twilight under blue skies
And I feel like dancin
All night long

Such a lovely night ... for dancin'
And I get this feelin' full of song
Love sunset's into twilight
And I feel like the music really turns me on
Love twilight under blue skies
And I feel like dancin all night long

Get up and dance with me ....
