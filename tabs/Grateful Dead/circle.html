Will The Circle Be Unbroken
A.P. Carter

      E
I was standing by my window
     A               E 
On a cold and cloudy day,
E
When I saw the hearse come rollin'
               B7    E
For to take my love away.

Chorus:
     Will the circle be unbroken?
     By and by Lord, by and by,
     There's a better home a-waitin'
     In the sky Lord, in the sky.

I told the undertaker,
"Undertaker, please drive slow,
For this body you are haulin' Lord,
I hate to see him go."

Well I followed close behind him,
Tried to hold up and be brave,
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid him in the grave.
