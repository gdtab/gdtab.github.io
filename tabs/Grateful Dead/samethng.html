The Same Thing
Willie Dixon

Dm
What makes a man go crazy
Dm
When a woman wears her dress so tight
Dm
What makes a man go crazy
Dm
When a woman wears that ol' dress so tight
            A
Must be the same ol' thing
            G                 Dm
That make a tom cat fight all night

Now, why do all the big men
Try to run a big-legged woman down
Now, why do all the big men
Try to run a big ol' woman down
Must be the same ol' thing
That makes a bulldog a huggling 'round

Dm
It's that ol' same thing,
            A
Now tell me who's to blame
    Bb             A
The whole world is fighting
               Dm
About that ol' same thing

What make you feel so good
When your baby's in her evening gown
What make you feel so good
When your baby get a little bit of an evening gown
Must be that same ol' thing
That makes a preacher lay his bible down

It's that ol' same thing, it's that ol' same thing
