Mercy of a Fool
artist?
Lyrics Only

She reclines, closing her eyes the silhouette
Is bound to Writhe
Light birds and fireflies settle around her
Days grow, long strange feeling,

Waterfalls shine this time of year
Our lives go down the stream,
Shooting the rapids bright as gold
The arms you gave me bright as the eye of the hurricane

We're all just the sage going.
Every moment is perfect, no sin is a jewel
If man is a prophet at the mercy of a fool
Watching seasons go as sunshine turns blue and blue so close

The great ghost feeling the music is
Every beat knows its part, keep its spirit in a circle
The moment is perfect, the eye's a jewel
If man is a prophet with the mercy of a fool
