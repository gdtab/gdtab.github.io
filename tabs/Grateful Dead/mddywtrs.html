Muddy Waters
Muddy Waters

            G                  D
I washed my hands in the muddy water 
                                         G
I washed my hands but they wouldn't come clean
                               C
I washed my hands in the muddy water
      G                   D                G
But I must have washed my hands in a muddy stream

      G              D
I was born in old Virginia
                      G
North Carolina, I did roam
       G                      C
If I'd listened to what daddy told me
  G               D            G
I would not be so rude and all alone
