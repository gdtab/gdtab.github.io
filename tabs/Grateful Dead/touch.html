Touch I Like
?artist?

I - IV - V blues, in A, 5/21/75 Keystone

Red ribbon in your hair
I'm kinda glad that you put it there
That's the touch I like
That's the touch I like
Oh, that's the touch I like

You ain't got no words to waste,
Just sweet old-fashioned taste,
That's the touch I like
That's the touch I like
Oh, that's the touch I like

Bridge
Like to come and see you sometime, Baby,
You look fine and pretty
And I'd be on my very best behavior
Hold the doors and coats for you
Try to be witty
Using all my cool to win you favor

Red flowers in your hair
I'm kinda glad that you put it there
That's the touch I like
That's the touch I like
Oh, that's the touch I like

Jam, I - IV - V blues

You ain't got no words to waste,
Just sweet old-fashioned taste,
That's the touch I like
That's the touch I like
Oh, that's the touch I like

Bridge

Yellow flowers 'round your hand
Your pretty eyes so bright and clear
That's the touch I like
That's the touch I like
Oh, that's the touch I like

You ain't got no words to waste,
Just sweet old-fashioned taste,
That's the touch I like
That's the touch I like
Oh, that's the touch I like

Your eyes so clear and bright
I like seein' them every night
That's the touch I like
That's the touch I like
Oh, that's the touch I like
