       G        D
It was good one time
     C                G
Everything was mighty fine
    G           D              C      G
The coal tipple rolled day and night
    G               D
And things they got slow
    C               G
For reasons I don't know
        G                D           C      G
And the chill winds they pulled into sight

The mine's all closed down
Everybody layin' around
There wasn't very much left to do
But to stand in that line
Get your rations strict on time
And woman I could see it killin' you

Chorus: G                C
Now the soft new snow of December
        Bm             D(II)
Lightly falls my cabin round
        Am                   Em
Saw the last train from Poor Valley
*        D            C              G
Bringing brown-haired Becky Richmond bound
*Bringin'/takin' brown-haired/long-haired Becky/Peggy Richmond bound

Been comin' all night long
Soon we'll be gone
Leavin' crossed your mind everyday
And then you said to me
"Things are bad back home you see"
I guess I'd better be on my way

Chorus

I should hate you now
But I never could somehow
A miners wife you were not cut out to be
It wasn't what you thought
Just some dreams you bought
When you left home and ran away with me

Chorus (last two lines x2)
