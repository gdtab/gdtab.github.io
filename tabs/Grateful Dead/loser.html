Am          G             C          D
If I had a gun for every ace I have drawn,
C             Em               Am
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Am                C  G  Em                D
Don't you push me baby 'cause I'm moanin' low
        C        C/B  Am    G       Am
and you know I'm only in it for the gold

All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars
And I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
And you'll never find another honest man.

G         D           A
Last fair deal in the country, Sweet Suzie
G         D           A
Last fair deal in the town
G             D                A
Put your gold money where your love is baby,
  C        C/B    Am   G   D          Am
Before you let my deal go down,    go down.

Don't you push me baby, cause I'm moanin' low
Well I know a little something you won't ever know
Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
I'm gonna get up in the morning and go

Everybody prayin' and drinkin' that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on the inside straight,
Well I got no chance of losin' this time
