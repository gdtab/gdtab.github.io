Please don't tell what train I'm on

They won't know what route I'm going.

C     F  G  C

When I'm dead and in my grave
No more good times here I crave
Place the stones at my head and feet;
And tell them all I've gone to sleep.

When I die, oh bury me deep
Down at the end of old Chestnut Street
So I can hear old Number Nine
As, she comes, rolling by.

When I die, oh bury me deep
Down at the end of old Chestnut Street
Face the stones at my head and feet
And tell them all I've gone to sleep.

Repeat first verse.
