He Was a Friend of Mine
Bob Dylan
Lyrics Only

He was, he was a friend of mine
He was, he was a friend of mine
Now he's dead and gone
This morning my best friend was sleeping in his bed
His face like a jewel and he was dead
He liked to play games or push me on a swing
Or push me on a merry-go-round, so round and round
