Let's Spend The Night Together
The Rolling Stones
Ab                           Gm
Don't you worry 'bout what's on your mind
        Eb7
(oh my, da da da da da da da da)
Ab                    Gm
I'm in no hurry I can take my time
        Eb7
(oh my, da da da da da da da da)
Db                                      Ab
I'm going red and my tongue's getting tied
Db
I'm off my head and my mouth's getting dry
Cm
(I'm high, but I try, try, try...oh my)
Eb7
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
                               Ab    Gm  Eb7
Let's spend the night together now

I feel so strong that I can't disguise
(oh my, let's spend the night together)
But I just can't apologise
(oh no, let's spend the night together)
Don't hang me up and don't let me down
We could have fun just grooving around
(around and around oh my, my)
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together

Db
Let's spend the night together
Ab
Now I need you more than ever
Db
Let's spend the night together
Ab
You know I'm smiling, baby
Db
You need some guiding, baby
Ab
I'm just deciding, baby
    Eb
Now I need you more than ever
Eb7
Let's spend the night together
                                     Ab | Gm | Eb7 |
Let's spend the night together now

This doesn't happen to me every day
(oh my, let's spend the night together)
No excuses offered anyway
(oh my, let's spend the night together)
I'll satisfy your every need
And now I know you will satisfy me
