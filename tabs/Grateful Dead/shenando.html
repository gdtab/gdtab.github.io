Away, I'm bound away, across the wide Missouri.

The trader loved this Indian maiden
Away you rolling river
With notions his, canoe was laden
Away, I'm bound away, across the wide Missouri.

0h Shenandoah, I love your daughter
Away you rolling river
For I've crossed the rolling water
Away, I'm bound away, across the wide Missouri.

0h Shenandoah, I'm bound to leave you
Away you rolling river
0 Shenandoah, I'll not deceive you
Away, I'm bound away, across the wide Missouri.

Oh Shenandoah, I long to hear you
Away you rolling river
Oh Shenandoah, I lone to hear you
Away, I'm bound away, across the wide Missouri.
