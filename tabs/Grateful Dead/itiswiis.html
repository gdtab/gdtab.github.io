It Is What It Is
Mydland / Barlow
Lyrics Only

It's a cobbled dance that no one planned
Least of all the dancer, a crap shoot dream you summon
From the corner of one eye.
If you need an explanation, there's a quick and easy answer.
Stop thinking for a moment and give this one a try:

Just say: It is what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is,
Hey, it is what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is

It is what it is, what it might have been, it isn't.
An infinity of mornings, and only one shines through.
It is what it is, gonna grab the day we're given,
'Cause it is what it is, and what it is will have to do.

You stop waiting for the check to come, the postman's on vacation.
Take a job that starts at midnight, give completely up on luck.
A scientologist comes knocking, when you to battle stations,
He says, "Wait, my name's Mark Anthony,
And here's your million bucks."

Oh well, it is what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is
Hey, it is what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is,

It is what it is, what you had in mind, it won't be
Despite your great endeavors, the prize comes free to you.
It is what it is, if you feel surprised, then don't be,
'Cause it is what it is, and what it is will have to do.

Animals eat animals, creation eats the winner.
Fall down to the beetles, and start back up again.
It's a long way up the chain of life, not easy for beginners.
You'll find that it's no easier for elephants or men.

But hey, it is what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is,
Yeah, it is what it is, what it is, what it is, what it is,
It is what it is, it is what it is
What it might have been, it isn't.

An infinity of mornings, and only one shines through.
It is what it is, gonna grab the day we're given,
'Cause it is what it is, and what it is will have to do.
