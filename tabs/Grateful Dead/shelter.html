Shelter From the Storm
Bob Dylan
 D						  G                   D
'Twas in another life time, one of toil and blood.
                                    G
When blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud.
D                                G
I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form.
      D
"Come in" she said, "I'll give you,
G
Shelter from the storm."

And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured,
I'll always do my best for her on that I give my word.
In a world of steel eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm,
"Come in" she said, "I'll give you
Shelter from the storm."

Not a word was spoke between us there was little risk involved.
everything up to that point, had been left unresolved.
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm
"Come in" she said "I'll give you
Shelter from the storm."

I was burned out from exhaustion I was buried in the hail.
Poisoned in the bushes an' blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn
"Come in" she said "I'll give you
Shelter from the storm."

Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair.
She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
"Come in" she said "I'll give you
Shelter from the storm."

Now there's a wall between us something has been lost.
I took too much for granted I got my signals crossed
Just to think that all began on an uneventfull morn
"Come in" she said "I'll give you
Shelter from the storm."

Well the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters it's doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker he blows a futile horn
"Come in" she said "I'll give you
Shelter from the storm."

I've heard newborn babies wailin' like a mornin' dove
And old men with broken teeth stranded without love.
Do I understand your question, man is it hopeless and forlorn.
"Come in" she said "I'll give you
Shelter from the storm."

In a little hill top village, I gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation and they gave me a leathal dose.
I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn
"Come in" she said "I'll give you
Shelter from the storm."

Well I'm livin' in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line
Beauty walk a razors edge, someday I'll make it mine.
If I could only turn the clock back to when God and her were born
"Come in" she said "I'll give you
Shelter from the storm."
