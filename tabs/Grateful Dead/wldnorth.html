E            A    E
Well, it's a wild northland
B                        E
Velvet green isle with a sky blue ring
           A    E
Hey it's a wild northland
  B                      E
A cold steel trap with a frozen spring

           A        E
Well, he's cold and tired
          B             E
He's been travelin' all day
         A        E              B     E
You know Juneau's just a hundred miles away

And he's found his gold, he dug it from that ground
But today's he's a lost, tomorrow night found

Chorus 1
It was just last spring, he found his golden gates
Now his greed kept a telling' him that winter would wait

But now his autumn's gone, and the skies are gray
Lord the land is all white he can't find his way

Chorus 2
Baby it's a wild northland
He knew she'd never marry him while he was poor
And it's a wild northland
And get down on your knees and dig a little more

Chorus 1
