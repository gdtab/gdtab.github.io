E
Talkin' to my lawyer in the jailhouse foyer
   A
Convinced me of my darkest fears
   B
He said that judge has got a reefer grudge
     D
He's bound to give you twenty years

C#m                E
Goodbye yer honor, please excuse me jumpin' bail
C#m                  D                          E
Goodbye yer honor, I just ain't got no time for jail
D                        B
Consider me the goner, I guess it's time to hit that trail

Tell the prosecutor he's a lousy loser
He's tryin' to sully my lifestyle
He set that date, tell him not to wait
I won't be comin' to my trial
I hope I won't offend ya, but maybe I can send ya
A postcard from a distant land
'Cause all your bars can't block my stars
It's more than I can really stand

E
Bye bye, bye bye, goodbye yer honor, goodbye (4)
