Chorus
      A                              D
I'm a-knockin on your door again, my darling
      E                                   A
I'm a-knockin on your door, please answer me
         A                             D
But I've tried to make you realize, my darling
          E                              A
Well that no one else was ever meant for me

Well I remember, dear, you sent me all your loving?
And you promised your happiness so true
But now you've gone away, dear, with another
I wonder if you feel the way I do

Chorus

Jam

I'm a-knockin on your door again, my darling
I'm a-knockin on your door, please answer me
I never read the letters that you wrote, my little darling
Well I'm sailing far across the deep blue sea

I'm a-knockin on your door again, my darling
To return the letters that you wrote to me
I'm a-knockin on your door again, my darling
This time, honey, I'm sure things are gonna be

Jam

So goodbye, my dear, I know you'll soon forget me
And I hope that you find happiness so true
But whatever you make ??, sweetheart, remember
That my lovin' always be the same for you

Chorus
I'm a-knockin on your door again, my darling
I'm a-knockin on your door, please answer me
But I've tried to make you realize, my darling
Well that no one else was ever meant for me

Jam
