Bm        A                     E                  A
Picture a bright blue ball just spinning, spinning free
Bm  G             A       
Dizzy with eternity.
E                                 A                   E
Paint it with a skin of sky, brush in some clouds and sea
        Bm                      A
Call it home for you and me.

A peaceful place or so it looks from space
A closer look reveals the human race.
Full of hope, full of grace, is the human face.
But afraid, we may our lay home to waste.

          E
There's a fear down here we can't forget 
E
Hasn't got a name just yet
E
Always awake, always around 
E
Singing ashes,ashes all fall down, ashes,ashes,all fall down

Now watch as the ball revolves and the nighttime falls
And again the hunt begins and again the bloodwind calls
By and by again, the morning sun will rise
But the darkness never goes from some men's eyes.

It strolls the sidewalks and it rolls the streets
Staking turf, dividing up meat.
Nightmare spook, piece of heat, 
It's you and me, you and me.

Click, flashblade in ghetto night.
Rudies looking for a fight.
Rat cat alley roll them bones.
Need that cash to feed that jones
And the politicians throwing stones
Singing ashes,ashes all fall down, ashes,ashes all fall down


C#m            A                  E
Commissars and pin-striped bosses role the dice
Bm           G                      A
Any way they fall guess who gets to pay the price.
E              A           E
Money green or proletarian gray, 
        Bm                     A   
Selling guns instead of food today.

So the kids they dance, they shake their bones
And the politicians throwing stones
Singing ashes,ashes all fall down, ashes,ashes,all fall down

Heartless powers try to tell us what to think
If the spirit's sleeping, then the flesh is ink.
And history's page, it is thusly carved in stone
The future's here, we are it, we are on our own.

If the game is lost then we're all the same
No one left to place or take the blame.
We will leave this place an empty stone
Or this shinning ball of blue we can call our home

So the kids they dance, they shake their bones
And the politicians are throwing stones
Singing ashes,ashes all fall down, ashes,ashes all fall down

Shooting powders back and forth
Singing "black goes south while white comes north"
And the whole world full of petty wars
Singing "I got mine and you got yours."

And the current fashions set the pace.
Lose your step, fall out of grace.
And the radical he rant and rage, 
Singing "someone got to turn the page"

And the rich man in his summer home,
Singing "Just leave well enough alone"
But his pants are down, his cover's blown
And the politicians are throwing stones
So the kids they dance they shake their bones
Cause its all too clear we're on our own
Singing ashes,ashes all fall down, ashes,ashes all fall down

Picture a bright blue ball just spinning, spinning free
It's dizzying, the possibilities. 

Ashes, Ashes all fall down.

 "Throwing Stones"

 Written in Cora, Wyoming, August -December, 1982

 Recorded on In The Dark.

 First performed September 17, 1982 at the Cumberland County Civic Center in Portland, Maine. In the repertoire ever since.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------

 Ashes, ashes, all fall down

 From a children's rhyme, which, according to The Annotated Mother Goose, is not really all that old, dating back to Kate Greenaway's 1881 Mother Goose. So much for all the theories claiming that the song refers to the Black Plague. It's basically a ring dance, where all the kids get to dance and shake their bones," and fall down at the end. No heavy subtext.

There are many variations on the rhyme (interesting or unbelievable that they all should have devloped since the 1880's...) 
Here are a few:
          "Ring-a-ring-r-roses,
           A pocket full of posies;
           Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush!
           We've all tumbled down."--The Annotated Mother Goose


           "Ring-a-ring o' roses,
           A pocket full of posies
           A-tishoo! A-tishoo!
           We all fall down.

           The cows are in the meadow
           Lying fast asleep,
           A-tishoo! A-tishoo!
           We all get up again."--The Oxford Nursery Rhyme Book

    *

           "A ring, a ring o' roses,
           A pocket full of posies,
           Ash-a! Ash-a!
           All stand still.

           The king has sent his daughter
           To fetch a pail of water,
           Ash-a! Ash-a!
           All bow down.

           The bird upon the steeple
           Sits high above the people,
           Ash-a! Ash-a!
           All kneel down.

           The wedding bells are ringing,
           The boys and girls are singing,
           Ash-a! Ash-a!
           All fall down."--The Oxford Nursery Rhyme Book

    * And the way I remember from childhood:

           Ring a ring a rosies,
           Pocket full of posies,
           Ashes! Ashes!
           All fall down!

 An essay on the influence of nursery rhymes, Grateful Goose, is available.

  jones

 From the Oxford English Dictionary:

      "Jones...2. slang. A drug addict's habit. 1968 Sun Mag.
      (Baltimore) 13 Oct. 19/4 Soon you're out to keep from
      getting the Jones. 1970 C. MAJOR Dict. Afro-Amer. Slang 71
      Jones, a fixation; drug habit; compulsive attachment."

No one seems to have a theory on the origin of the word, but it appears to have appeared quite recently in its current meaning, say about 1965.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------

 If the spirit's sleeping, then the flesh is ink

 Maybe I'm imagining this connection, but there's another children's rhyme:

      "If all the world were paper,
      And all the sea were ink,
      If all the trees were bread and cheese,
      What should we have to drink?"--Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes, p. 436

 And this note from a reader:

      Date: Tue, 12 Dec 1995 13:02:19 GMT
      From: Alex Allan
      Subject: Re: "If the spirit's sleeping, then the flesh is ink"

      I always heard echoes of the biblical reference:
      "The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak"

      Best wishes - and happy Christmas

 we are on our own

 Reminiscent of the Neil Young song, "Ohio" which includes the lines:

      "Tin soldiers and Nixon coming
      We're finally on our own
      This summer I hear the drumming
      Four dead in Ohio."

 --------------------------------------------------------------------

 Shipping powders back and forth...

 In Conversations with the Dead, David Gans reveals that he wrote these lines about cocaine and gunpowder.
