 Tough Mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?    

Dark beauty, won't you move over and make some room.
It's my duty, to take you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise.
You come through it all the way, flyin' through the sky.
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.

Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind.
Don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
Jack the cowboy went up north his buried in your past.
Lone Wolf went out drinking, but that was over pretty fast.
Sweet Goddess, your perfect stranger's comin' on in at last.

Silver angel, with the badge of a lonesome road sewed on your sleeve
I'd be grateful, if this golden ring you could receive.
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch.
Stood alone upon a ridge, and all I did was watch.
Dark beauty, must be time to carve another notch.

Crestfallen, world of illusions at my door.
I ain't a-haulin', any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
Mission walls are crumblin' down there is no end in sight.
Gained some recognition, but I've lost my appetite.
Dark beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.
