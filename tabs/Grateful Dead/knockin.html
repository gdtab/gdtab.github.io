Knockin' On Heaven's Door
Bob Dylan
G         D               Am7
Mama take this badge from me
G                 D      C
'Cause I can't use it anymore
G                 D            Am7
It's getting dark, too dark to see
G              D                    C     D
feels like I'm knocking on heaven's door____

G             D                    Am7
knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
G             D                    C     D
knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door____
G             D                    Am7
knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
G             D                    C     D
knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door____

Mama put those guns to the ground
'Cause I can't shoot them anymore
That cold black cloud is comin' down
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
just like so many times before
knock, knock, knocking on heaven's do-o-or.

G    D    Am7    G
Oo - oo - oo - oo

Additional verses:

Come take these guns off of me
'Cause I won't shoot them anymore
Lord the sun is setting over me
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

Come wipe these tears from my eyes
I won't shed them anymore
The sun is setting in western skies
People I believe I must be knockin' on heaven's door

Baby stay right here with me
'Cause I can't see you anymore
This ain't the way it's supposed to be
I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door

Son won't you remember me?
I can't be with you anymore
A lawman's life is never free
I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door.

Additional lyrics:

Mama, wipe the blood from my face
I'm sick and tired of the war
Got a lonely hard feeling and it's hard to trace
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.

Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore.
That long black train is a-pullin' on down
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.

Mama, wipe the blood off of my face
I can't see through it anymore
i need someone to talk to and I've no hiding place
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.

Mama, I can hear that thunder roar
Echoin' down from God's distant shore
I can hear 'em callin' out from my soul
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.

Mama, put my guns in back the ground
I can't fire them anymore.
That long black cloud is fallin' down
I feel I'm lookin' at heaven's door.

Mama, take this blood off of my face
I can't see through it anymore
It's a feeling I just can't trace
Feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door.

Mama, tow my barge down to sea
Pull it down from shore to shore
Two brown eyes lookin' at me
Feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door.

Goin' down by that road
Feelin' down more and more
Take a chain _________________         
Feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door.

Mama, take my ______ and my __________
I don't want it anymore
Two brown eyes starin' into my face
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.

Mama, take my poor star far away
Let it fall down to the floor
But it's so far so ________ to stay
Feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.

Mama, take this gun and put it far away
I won't fire it anymore
I'll be leavin' for far away
Feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door.

Mama, wipe these tears off of my face
I can't see through them anymore
Gettin' out of here into some other place
I feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door.

Mama wipe the tears from my eyes
I just can't see thru them anymore
It's getting harder and harder to see thru this sunrise
And I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

Mama wipe the tears from my eyes
I just can't see thru them anymore
Does it come as any surprise
that I am knockin' on heaven's door

Mama, wipe the blood from my face
I can't see through it anymore
Sometimes I feel so out of place
And I feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door.
