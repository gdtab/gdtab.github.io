I'll Be With Thee
artist?
Lyrics Only

Just like the prodigal son, when he was far from home.
He wanted to go back & tell his father he had done wrong.
He fell on his knees, oh Lord, answer this please, & said,
"If you go back home I'll go with thee."

Just like the Israelites, who were Pharaoh's slaves.
They suffered in bondage & they prayed for days.
The Lord said, "Moses, go set them free."
I am the Lord, by God, & I'll go with thee.

Just like oh Joshua, Jericho, Jericho walls, he wanted to overthrow.
The Lord said, "Fight, & I'll give you victory."
I am the Lord by God, & I'll go with thee.
He said, "I'll be with thee, whenever you're in trouble."

"I'll be with thee, you don't have to worry."
"I'll be with thee, 'cause the power's in my hands."
"I'll be with thee, through the water, through the flood, through
The fire, through the blood."

I am the Lord, by God, & I'll be with thee, I'll be with thee.
Here him saying, "I'll be with thee."
I could hear God saying, "I'll be with thee."
You don't have to worry, "I'll be with thee."

You don't have to be afraid, "I'll be with thee."
Through failure, success, I'll understand when you done your best.
I am the Lord, by God, & I'll be with thee, I'll be with thee.
