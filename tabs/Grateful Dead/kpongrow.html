I was  laughing,
D/A                              A
 Laying in the streets, I wasn't  knowing;
  G       D     A
I  didn't  know  my fate.

 Playing
    D/A                             A
The  game of love, but never really  showing
    G             D         A
The  thought that  love was  great.
E                      D           A
 I was a young man and  sure to go  astray.
E                                  D                          F#m   E
 You walked right into my life and  told me love would find a way
           A         D        A         D        A         D
To keep on  growing,  keep on  growing,  keep on  growing.

I was  standing,
D/A                             A
 Looking in the face of one who  loved me,
G        D   A
 Feeling  so  ashamed.
A
 Hoping,
    D/A                                 A
And  praying, Lord, that she could understand me,
      G       D         A
But I  didn't  know her  name.
E                             D              A
 She took my hand in hers and  told me I was  wrong.
E                                         D           F#m   E
 She said, you're gonna be all right boy,  oh just as  long
               A         D        A         D        A
As you keep on  growing,  keep on  growing,  keep on
         D
growing.
G      D      A
 Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.

 Lady,
D/A                                A
 Someday, baby, who knows where or  when, Lord,
G         D         A
 Just you  wait and  see.
         A
We'll be  walking,
  D/A                           A
Together hand in hand along the  way, love.
G          D      A
 Hope it's  still  me.
E                   D                       A
 This time is gonna  change us, Lord, and I  know it's true;
E                                      D
 Our love is gonna keep on growing and  growing
                             F#m   E
     and it's all because of  you.

Keep on  growing,  keep on  growing,  keep on  growing.
