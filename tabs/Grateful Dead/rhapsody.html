A                               E
I love to hear that Rhapsody in Red
A                                E    B
It just knocks me right outta my head
C#m  C#m/C    C#m          C#m/C      B
     Lifts me up here just floatin' around
C#m  C#m/C        C#m       G#        A
     Sends me way up and it don't let down
    B         E
Let down, let down

I love to hear that Rhapsody in Red
On my feet or laid back in my bed
Takes me way back where I don't mind
Takes me way back in my time, 
In my time, in my time

G#                            C#m        F#
Sail away on that Rhapsody in Red 
                                  (Sail away)
G#                                    B
Don't care where those other rainbows led
With all those Northern lights just blowin' away
Got no thought to relate in the same old way, 
Anyway, anyway

Love to feel it flood down to my soul
Lovin' feel just like days of old
I sing blues where has it led
Gimmie some more Rhapsody in Red, 
In Red, in Red
