Heartbreak Hotel
M.B. Axton/Tommy Durden/E.Presley
 E
Ever since my baby left me,
I found a new place to dwell.
                            E7
It's down at the end of lonely street at Heartbreak Hotel.

Chorus:
   A7
	  You make me so lonely baby, I get so lonely,
   B7                       E
	  I get so lonely  I could die.

And although it's always crowded,
you still can find some room.
Where broken hearted lovers do cry away their gloom.

Chorus

Well, the Bell hop's tears keep flowin',
and the desk clerk's dressed in black.
Well they been so long on lonely street
They ain't ever gonna look back.

Chorus

Hey now, if your baby leaves you,
and you got a tale to tell.
Just take a walk down lonely street to Heartbreak Hotel.

Repeat chorus and fade
