C7
Well, it ain't no use for you to cry,
          F7
Woman you best just dry your eyes,
            C7                G7
You hurt me so, I want you to know,
         C7             G7
It's too late, It's too late.

There was a time you was my pride and joy
Woman I loved you like a child loves a toy
You done me wrong, now you wanna come home
But it's too late, it's too late

F           Em
I-I-I-I-I-I wanted you,
Dm                 C
You wanted someone else.
Bb                C
You went away and left me here
Dm                 Em
Left me all by my, left me all by my,
Dm             G7
Left me all by myself

Now, it's your turn to cry, pay for your mistakes
Woman I loved you, but it's too late
You hurt me so, I want you to know
It's no use, It's no use
