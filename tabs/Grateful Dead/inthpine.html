In The Pines
Traditional

In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
I shivered where the cold winds blow
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
I shivered where the cold winds blow

Little girl, little girl, where'd you sleep last night?
Not even your mother knows
I stayed in the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
I shivered where the cold winds blow.

The prettiest girl that I ever did see
Lived in the Georgia pines
And the only girl that I ever did love
I knew she'd never be mine

Little girl, little girl, what have I done
That makes you treat me so?
You caused me to weep and you caused me to mourn
Like I never done before

Little girl, little girl, don't you lie to me
Tell me where did you get that dress?
From a man in the pines, where the sun never shines
I shivered where the cold winds blow

In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
I shivered where the cold winds blow
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines
I shivered where the cold winds blow
