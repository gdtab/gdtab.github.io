O say can you see, by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro' the perilous fight,
O're the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof thru' the night that our flag was still there
O say, does that star spangled banner yet wave
O're the land of the free and the home of the brave?

On the shores, dimly seen thro' the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes
What is that which the breze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In full glory reflected, now shines on the steam:
'Tis the star spangled banner: O lang may it wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
A home and a country should leave us no more?
Their blood has wash'd out their foul footsteps' pollution
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave:
And the star spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

O thus be it ever when free man shall stand
Between their lov'd homes and the war's desolation;
Blest with vict'r and peace, may the heav'n rescued land
Praise the power that hath made and preserved us a nation!
Then conquer we must when our cause it is just,
And this be our motto: "In God is our Trust!"
And the star spangled banner in triumph shall wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!



Well, there it is, music and all four verses.  In case you didn't know, we 
stole the music from an old English drinking song called "anacheron in 
heaven"  Enjoy
